      "Abstract:  Na genealogia do hacker é possível perceber relações entre ideologias aparentemente contraditórias como as promovidas por criadores de vírus e as praticadas por empresários do Vale do Silício. Esta ambiguidade ideológica é transferida às mídias digitais em um modelo de produção que emprega elementos lúdicos para estimular o lucro, transformando trabalho em brincadeira. Neste contexto, expandir os limites da tecnologia implica na ampliação de mecanismos de controle. Exploramos este paradoxo através de teorias que questionam a confiança depositada nos algoritmos e de práticas artísticas que rompem com funcionalidades pré-determinadas. Os trabalhos apresentados inserem espaços de reflexão e dúvida em sistemas baseados na exatidão científica. A poética surge, portanto, na interrupção ou no desvio de funcionamentos objetivos, ainda que de forma momentânea. Relatamos, por fim, os experimentos práticos desenvolvidos com bots que ora cruzam, ora amontoam mensagens de conversas digitais, gerando estranheza em interações rotineiras.\n",

      "Title:  O transbordamento do lúdico e da biopolítica em jogos Massive Multiplayer online: um estudo sobre World of Warcraft\n",
      "Author:  Chagas, Artur Alves de Oliveira \n",
      "Abstract:  Os jogos eletrônicos denominados Massive Multiplayer Online, nos quais milhares de pessoas podem estar conectadas simultaneamente, são tomados como exemplo atual de jogos coletivos. A partir da análise biopolítica de Michel Foucault, são investigadas as construções identitárias individuais, os papéis sociais e compromissos assumidos com outros jogadores e as aprendizagens e disciplinas reforçadas em tais jogos, tomando como referência o jogo World of Warcraft, o mais popular do gênero, atualmente. O trabalho de campo foi realizado com jogadores e com os websites oficiais do jogo selecionado, por onde circulam os regimes de verdades que aqui nos interessam. A cibercultura é compreendida, neste trabalho, como condição da engenharia social que reconfigura as distâncias e limites físicos e temporais, reforçando modos de sujeição sempre mais individualizados e referenciados por discursos de agrupamentos espraiados. O tipo de jogo analisado neste trabalho, além de tornar-se popular por empregar instrumentos e práticas próprias das novas tecnologias eletrônicas, favorece a análise de que as formas de governo e de controle sobre a vida estejam cada vez mais apuradas, transbordando por todos os planos da existência. Tal análise possibilita a problematização de discursos científicos, principalmente na última década, a respeito das práticas entre sujeitos, envolvendo jogos eletrônicos, e principalmente quando se referem às práticas em educação e aprendizagem.\n",

      "Author:  Prates, Jorge Marques \n",
      "Abstract:  A inserção de tecnologias educacionais vem provocado transformações no cenário atual de ensino. Como exemplo dessas novas tecnologias, destacam-se os MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), cursos abertos e on-line, disponibilizados em provedores em parceria com universidades conceituadas. Em sua maioria, são cursos gratuitos que possibilitam a construção de comunidades de aprendizagem, a atualização profissional e o enriquecimento do currículo. Os SPOCs (Small Private Online Courses) são uma variação dos MOOCs, diferenciando-se destes por se tratarem de cursos privados e restritos a um pequeno número de participantes, o que proporciona maior interação entre alunos e os instrutores. Os MOOCs e os SPOCs são recursos ainda utilizados de forma escassa no ensino de Engenharia de Software, pois existe um número reduzido de cursos abertos e não uma há uma diretriz para a sua produção e aplicação. Além disso, o processo de produção é extenso e custoso, havendo poucas estratégias de reutilização de materiais abertos para diminuir o tempo e o esforço desta etapa. Este trabalho tem como objetivo principal investigar como o desenvolvimento distribuído e colaborativo de MOOCs e SPOCs pode contribuir ao ensino de Engenharia de Software. Nesse contexto, um processo (denominado DD-SMOOC) que apoia o ciclo de vida de MOOCs e SPOCs foi estabelecido no intuito de facilitar o planejamento, desenvolvimento, execução e evolução desses cursos. Com o intuito de validar o DD-SMOOC, um estudo de caso foi conduzido a partir da sua instanciação. O resultado final foi um curso em que os resultados obtidos indicam que a aplicação do processo pode ser útil no apoio ao ensino de Engenharia de Software. Outras contribuições incluem o estabelecimento de diretrizes no suporte ao desenvolvimento distribuído e colaborativo de cursos, que podem ser aplicados em outros domínios; e a formação de comunidades e redes de colaboração dispostas a contribuir em novos projetos.\n",

      "Abstract:  O crescimento explosivo no número de usuários de Internet levou arquitetos de software a reavaliarem questões relacionadas à escalabilidade de serviços que são disponibilizados em larga escala. Projetar arquiteturas de software que não apresentem degradação no desempenho com o aumento no número de acessos concorrentes ainda é um desafio. Neste trabalho, investigamos o impacto do sistema operacional em questões relacionadas ao desempenho, paralelização e escalabilidade de jogos interativos multi-usuários. Em particular, estudamos e estendemos o jogo interativo, multi-usuário, QuakeWorld, disponibilizado publicamente pela id Software sob a licença GPL.

      "Abstract:  A invenção e popularização do uso do computador e da internet a partir da segunda metade do século XX vieram acompanhadas de uma cultura da colaboração, liberdade de expressão e autogoverno. Na medida em que as novas mídias, em especial os videogames e as redes sociais, marcados pela interatividade, participação e colaboração, foram incorporadas pela sociedade, passamos a testemunhar a transmissão desta cultura do mundo digital para o nosso cotidiano do mundo real. Este trabalho busca apresentar a trajetória do desenvolvimento dos computadores e videogames ressaltando a filosofia hacker que os criou e a dicotomia entre seus ideais libertários e sua apropriação pelos meios corporativos, dando especial atenção à sua associação com movimentos sociais que culminaram no ciberativismo moderno e suas vertentes. Esta apresentação serve de base para o estudo do caso do Projeto Jogo Justo, uma ação coletiva com uso da internet que buscava a criação de uma política favorável à indústria de videogames no Brasil, sua relação com ações políticas tradicionais e com o ciberativismo, questionando sua viabilidade caso a Internet não existisse, compreendendo-a como uma nova forma de ação política através do uso de ferramentas de Internet e fruto desta nova cultura colaborativa.\n",

      "Author:  Oliveira, Guilherme Werneck de \n",
      "Abstract:  A Internet das coisas (IoT - Internet of Things) tem passado por uma rápida popularização, alcançando uma grande diversidade de domínios de aplicações. Como consequência, cada vez mais dispositivos IoT com características diversas são implantados em uma variedade de ambientes públicos e privados, tornando-se progressivamente objetos comuns da vida cotidiana. Por outro lado, a infraestrutura física de sistemas heterogêneos é complexa e exige soluções eficientes e dinâmicas para o gerenciamento de desempenho e segurança de redes, em um nível que permita a implantação padronizada e de fácil replicação em indústrias, prédios e cidades inteligentes. Uma abordagem que vem ganhando espaço quando o intuito é responder às ameaças de segurança na IoT consiste no uso de recursos virtualizados de rede por meio da virtualização de funções de rede (NFV - Network Functions Virtualization). A literatura apresenta alguns trabalhos que utilizam a NFV para detectar e mitigar ameaças de segurança em redes IoT, mas poucos são os indicadores de desempenho do contexto de rede explorados para a composição de uma solução de maior eficiência. Dessa forma, este trabalho apresenta o desenvolvimento de uma abordagem baseada no desempenho do contexto de rede para mitigar ataques distribuídos de negação de serviço (DDoS - Distributed Denial of Service) na IoT, investigando como indicadores de desempenho podem compor modelos de aprendizado de máquina (ML - Machine Learning) para o posicionamento de funções virtualizadas de redes (VNF - Virtual Network Functions). Modelos de ML foram treinados e testados a partir de indicadores de desempenho do contexto de rede para a realização de dois experimentos. O primeiro relacionado à predição do tempo de resposta de redes de Internet das coisas industriais (IIoT - Industrial Internet of Things). O segundo sobre o posicionamento de VNF de segurança, também em redes IIoT. Os respectivos resultados alcançados constituem em predições de tempos de resposta de rede que são no máximo 50 milissegundos maiores do que configurações realizadas por modelos de programação linear e classificações com 99,40% de acurácia para o correto posicionamento de VNF de segurança em redes IIoT sob ataques DDoS.\n",

      "Abstract:  A área de jogos para dispositivos móveis vem despertando o interesse cada vez maior de diversas pessoas, seja na área acadêmica ou de empresas comerciais, principalmente quando o desafio é desenvolver jogos multiusuário. No entanto, apesar do crescimento no número de frameworks e engines, e da ampliação das pesquisas nessa área, não existe ainda uma arquitetura padrão para o desenvolvimento de jogos para dispositivos móveis, devido principalmente à complexidade do problema, à grande diversidade de tipos de dispositivos móveis disponíveis no mercado e aos requisitos que diferem para cada tipo de jogo. O trabalho de pesquisa e desenvolvimento consistiu em, a partir de um estudo sobre o estado da arte e as necessidades de usuários e desenvolvedores, se desenvolver um framework para Jogos Multiplayer Móveis, denominado FMMG (Framework Mobile Multiplayer Games). Como resultado a Tese apresenta uma descrição detalhada da arquitetura do framework FMMG e dos módulos propostos, mostrando a integração entre eles, bem como as principais inovações que foram produzidas. A arquitetura do FMMG se baseia no padrão MVC (Model View Controller) e em uma estrutura de estado do jogo de acordo com os módulos preestabelecidos de gerenciamento, básico e rede. O framework resultante desta Tese visa dessa forma disponibilizar um conjunto de componentes que auxiliem na implementação de Jogos Multiplayer Móveis. Por fim, é apresentado um estudo de caso para a validação do framework desenvolvido, o qual demonstra o funcionamento dos principais recursos oferecidos.\n",

      "Abstract:  O Laboratório de Análise por Ativação com Nêutrons (LAN) do Instituto de Pesquisas Energéticas e Nucleares (IPEN), utiliza esta técnica analítica multielementar, baseada na irradiação de uma amostra por um feixe de nêutrons oriundos de um reator nuclear, que induz a radioatividade; que é medida em um espectrômetro de raios gama, para a obtenção dos espectros de raios gama. Neste trabalho é implementado um software denominado de SAANI (Software Análise por Ativação com Nêutrons Instrumental) para análise de espectros de raios gama, desenvolvido para os usuários do laboratório LAN-IPEN, com a filosofia de software livre, para a substituição do software existente VISPECT/VERSÃO 2, e tem como características principais: tornar a interface mais amigável; facilitar a padronização dos procedimentos realizados pelos pesquisadores, estudantes e técnicos; ser extensível com a utilização da tecnologia de plugins; multiplataforma; código livre. O software foi desenvolvido utilizando a linguagem de programação Python, a biblioteca gráfica Trolltech Qt e algumas de suas extensões científicas. Os resultados preliminares obtidos utilizando o software SAANI foram comparados aos obtidos com o software existente e foram considerados bons. Algumas diferenças encontradas foram verificadas oriundas de erros de precisão na implementação do software. O software SAANI está instalado nos computadores de usuários selecionados para a execução de rotinas de análise para uma maior verificação de sua robustez, precisão e usabilidade.\n",

      "Abstract:  A utilização da Internet cresceu amplamente nos últimos anos e tem propiciado o desenvolvimento de diversas ferramentas de comunicação via web. Têm se destacado, de maneira especial, as ferramentas que possibilitam a disponibilização online de conteúdos diversos, criados pelos próprios usuários, como as wikis. O sucesso obtido pelas wikis deve-se, em grande parte, à pequena quantidade de esforço necessário para a edição das páginas, indicando que esta característica é muito apreciada pelos usuários. Visando tornar o processo de edição de wikis ainda mais ágil, este trabalho apresenta uma proposta de como os mensageiros instantâneos podem auxiliar nesta tarefa. Assim, uma nova nova forma de interação no processo de edição de wikis, por meio de Mensageiro Instantâneo, foi projetada e implementada. Essa forma de interação proposta altera a forma de interação com wikis convencional, no sentido de possibilitar que o autor do conteúdo a ser editado na wiki não necessite mudar de seu ambiente de comunicação, que atualmente tem sido muito utilizado, o de troca de mensagens por meio do mensageiro instantâneo. Além disso, esta pesquisa possibilitou a identificação de diversas vantagens e desvantagens da utilização de bots de mensageiros instantâneos, encontradas na literatura, bem como durante os experimentos e estudos de caso realizados\n",

      "Author:  Martins Júnior, José \n",
      "Abstract:  O grande crescimento da Internet ocorreu a partir da década de 1990 com o surgimento dos provedores comerciais de serviços, e resulta principalmente da boa aceitação e vasta disseminação do uso da Web. O grande problema que afeta a escalabilidade e o uso de tal serviço refere-se à organização e à classificação de seu conteúdo. Os engenhos de busca atuais possibilitam a localização de páginas na Web pela comparação léxica de conjuntos de palavras perante os conteúdos dos hipertextos. Tal mecanismo mostra-se ineficaz quando da necessidade pela localização de conteúdos que expressem conceitos ou objetos, a exemplo de produtos à venda oferecidos em sites de comércio eletrônico. A criação da Web Semântica foi anunciada no ano de 2000 para esse propósito, visando o estabelecimento de novos padrões para a representação formal de conteúdos nas páginas Web. Com sua implantação, cujo prazo inicialmente previsto foi de dez anos, será possível a expressão de conceitos nos conteúdos dos hipertextos, que representarão objetos classificados por uma ontologia, viabilizando assim o uso de sistemas, baseados em conhecimento, implementados por agentes inteligentes de software. O projeto DEEPSIA foi concebido como uma solução centrada no comprador, ao contrário dos atuais Market Places, para resolver o problema da localização de páginas Web com a descrição de produtos à venda, fazendo uso de métodos de classificação de textos, apoiados pelos algoritmos k-NN e C4.5, no suporte ao processo decisório realizado por um agente previsto em sua arquitetura, o Crawler Agent. Os testes com o sistema em sites brasileiros denotaram a necessidade pela sua adaptação em diversos aspectos, incluindo-se o processo decisório envolvido, que foi abordado pelo presente trabalho. A solução para o problema envolveu a aplicação e a avaliação do método Support Vector Machines, e é descrita em detalhes.\n",

      "Author:  Luzzi, Thiago Emanuel \n",
      "Abstract:  O presente trabalho tem como objeto/corpus analisado a pornografia online, e tem como objetivo responder às questões: \"como é o gênero discursivo do pornô online?\" e \"onde se pode reconhecer a produção de subjetividade no dispositivo pornô online?\". As perguntas foram formuladas a partir do repertório conceitual minimalista da Análise Institucional do Discurso (AID), criada por Marlene Guirado; a AID é o método, a estratégia de pensamento que orienta o trabalho e o instrui acerca dos conceitos de discurso, gênero discursivo, instituição e subjetividade. Para realizar a pesquisa, procedemos em três etapas: (1) análise de sites; (2) análise de vídeos; e (3) análise de comentários de usuários. Cada etapa corresponde a um tipo de recorte para o material. No primeiro caso, decidimos seguir a estrutura de XVideos.com, cotejando-a pontualmente com as de oito outros sítios; no segundo, escolhemos um vídeo heterossexual \"profissional\" chamado Sex Instruction, podendo confrontá-lo com materiais de categorias diferentes (gay, amador etc.); na terceira etapa, observamos os comentários escritos anonimamente para os vídeos antes analisados, e para alguns outros. Como resultados, quanto ao gênero discursivo, vimos que o site define seu usuário como alguém que sabe aquilo por que se interessa, e procura ativa e responsavelmente o \"sexo explícito\"; essa posição de autonomia não se sustenta no interior do vídeo, onde prevalece o interesse da câmera e a imagem de um corpo muito peculiar, ali composto. Já quanto à questão do sujeito, pudemos ver que o site desenha um usuário que é assediado pelas imagens pornográficas, interpelado até mesmo como corpo sexual que pode ser comparado com aqueles do pornô; o sujeito é produzido como alguém que pode participar do pornô e de um apagamento que ele opera nas \"pessoas\", que acabam dissolvendo-se na atmosfera de êxtase incessante, na figura corporal pornográfica e até na linguagem utilizada no site. Conclui-se daí que o pornô online, embora prometa uma subserviência eficiente aos desejos de seu usuário, é uma instituição que absorve os consumidores em seu funcionamento, estabelecendo lugares discursivos, moldando subjetividades e instituindo concepções propriamente pornôs de corpo, de sexo e de comunidade\n",

      "Author:  Puccini, Flávia Rebelo Silva \n",
      "Abstract:  A eficiência da amamentação exige uma complexa coordenação entre sucção, deglutição e respiração, sendo que a tecnologia tem possibilitado importantes avanços na compreensão desse processo. Porém, não foram encontrados vídeos disponíveis na internet que demonstrassem a anatomia e fisiologia da amamentação, de modo didático e fidedigno à ciência atual. Este trabalho teve por objetivo descrever o desenvolvimento de uma sequência em computação gráfica sobre a sucção e a deglutição, resultante da produção digital do Bebê Virtual, bem como validar tal produção quanto ao conteúdo e prover adequações necessárias ao material educacional. Para a produção das iconografias em 3D da sucção e deglutição no Bebê Virtual, inicialmente foi elaborado um mapa conceitual e uma matriz de conteúdos, objetivos e competências voltadas ao material educacional. Posteriormente foi elaborado um roteiro científico que abordou a anatomia do crânio, face, cavidade oral, faringe, laringe e esôfago do recém-nascido, bem como, a descrição dos mecanismos fisiológicos relacionados à sucção e às fases oral e faríngea da deglutição no bebê. Para isso foram utilizadas 14 publicações do período de 1998 a 2008, que continham informações relevantes para demonstrar a amamentação. Os conteúdos teóricos foram organizados em cenas principais, possibilitando a criação de previews das sequências dinâmicas, as quais foram avaliadas por profissionais de anatomia, fonoaudiologia e medicina, possibilitando os ajustes necessários e a construção das imagens em computação gráfica 3D. Para análise da validade de conteúdo dessas imagens foi verificada a representatividade dos itens que o compõe, por meio de consulta à literatura. Foram incluídos estudos que utilizaram auxílio tecnológico e abordaram o tema proposto em bebês a termo e saudáveis, sem alterações neurológicas ou anomalias craniofaciais. Foram excluídas as publicações realizadas com bebês pré-termo, sindrômicos, com anomalias, doenças neurológicas ou qualquer alteração que pudesse interferir na amamentação, revisões de literatura e relatos de caso. Os artigos selecionados foram analisados e classificados quanto ao nível de evidência científica, predominando o nível três de evidência. A análise de conteúdo demonstrou a necessidade de adequações nas iconografias 3D, para que o processo de sucção e deglutição demonstrado no bebê virtual pudesse corresponder ao conhecimento científico atual. Tais adequações foram propostas a partir dos achados de 9 estudos, publicados entre 2008 e 2014, que utilizaram ultrassonografia para demonstrar como ocorre o processo de amamentação. Desta forma, foram modificados os aspectos da pega, da movimentação de língua, mandíbula, palato mole e laringe, além da sincronização da sucção/deglutição/respiração e deslocamento do mamilo, num processo desenvolvido em cinco etapas. Assim, o presente estudo descreveu o processo de desenvolvimento das iconografias em 3D sobre a anatomia e fisiologia da sucção e deglutição no recém-nascido a termo, sendo que a validade de conteúdo permitiu atualizar vários aspectos da amamentação do Bebê Virtual, quebrando velhos paradigmas e possibilitando ilustrar didaticamente as evidências científicas relacionadas.\n",

      "Author:  Lima, Marco Aurélio de \n",
      "Abstract:  O presente trabalho, concebido a partir da perspectiva da Análise Institucional de Discurso, objetiva desenhar a produção de subjetividade no âmbito de um suporte digital específico, de modo a delinear algumas imagens de si a partir da escolha de cinco weblogs de cunho pessoal. Para isto, foi necessário conduzir uma análise que visasse a configurar as cenas enunciativas constitutivas da escrita de si exibida nos blogs. Por meio dos corpora, realizaram-se três tarefas complementares: (1) montar as cenografias entendidas como cenas que legitimam o enunciado, que distribuem lugares discursivos entre enunciador e coenunciador e que engendram um intrincado jogo de expectativas; (2) estabelecer os ethé dos escreventes (ethé é plural de ethos, termo que designa a imagem que se pode formar do enunciador a partir do modo como este toma a palavra); e (3) evidenciar os efeitos de reconhecimento e desconhecimento configurados na enunciação. As análises realizadas permitem afirmar que, pela própria maneira de expressar-se no blog, o escrevente cria uma relação de intimidade e familiaridade com o leitor. Além disso, é possível dizer que, por meio de oposições e diferenciações do escrevente em relação a um interlocutor produzido no discurso, emerge uma imagem valorizada do eu, uma subjetividade como um elogio de si. O blog, muitas vezes, é visto como um espelho que reflete o que realmente se é, configurando, consequentemente, um eu consciente da verdade sobre si. Por fim, cumpre asseverar que, na escrita de si, presente nos corpora analisados, a vida é reconhecida como aquilo que acontece no blog. Em função dos contornos construídos pela análise, foi possível apontar, retomando as palavras de Michel Foucault, processos de subjetivação do discurso e objetivação do sujeito. Por fim, este trabalho também se constitui como uma apropriação do conceito de ethos, no âmbito da 8 Análise Institucional de Discurso\n",

      "Author:  Breve, Fabricio Aparecido (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Complex networks is a recent and active scientific research field, which concerns large scale networks with non-trivial topological structure, such as computer networks, telecommunication networks, transport networks, social networks and biological networks. Many of these networks are naturally divided into communities or modules and, therefore, uncovering their structure is one of the main problems related to complex networks study. This problem is related with the machine learning field, which is concerned with the design and development of algorithms and techniques which allow computers to learn, or increase their performance based on experience. Some of the problems identified in traditional learning techniques include: difficulties in identifying irregular forms in the attributes space; uncovering overlap structures of groups or classes, which occurs when elements belong to more than one group or class; and the high computational complexity of some models, which prevents their application in larger data bases. In this work, we deal with these problems through the development of new machine learning models using complex networks and space-temporal dynamics. The developed models have performance similar to those from some state-of-the-art algorithms, at the same time that they present lower computational complexity order than most of them\n",

      "Abstract:  We present a system able to orchestrate the procedural generation of multiple contents, using different computational creativity techniques, and able to generate the contents in real time. The generated contents are the dungeons, the placement of enemies, locks and keys in its rooms, the enemies that will be placed in said dungeons, quests for the player to complete, and the dungeons rooms. We use evolutionary algorithms, MAP-Elites, Formal Grammars, Markov Chains and Cellular Automata to create these contents. They are organized by an orchestrator and placed in a game prototype. In the late stage of the system, the content can be generated in real time, as soon as it collects data from the player to use as input, using a rule-based profile analysis. We also describe our architecture and system design, which allowed us to add new generators and change the algorithms for each generator with relative easy. Different experiments with players were made to test different algorithms and systems setups, all with positive results, and the players having fun playing the resulting contents. Players who played content based on their profile enjoyed it more than those playing content from another profile. Showing that our rule-based profiler can guide the generators to good results.\n",

      "Title:  Performance prediction of application executed on GPUs using a simple analytical model and machine learning techniques\n",
      "Author:  González, Marcos Tulio Amarís (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The parallel and distributed platforms of High Performance Computing available today have became more and more heterogeneous (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, etc). Graphics Processing Units (GPU) are specialized co-processor to accelerate and improve the performance of parallel vector operations. GPUs have a high degree of parallelism and can execute thousands or millions of threads concurrently and hide the latency of the scheduler. GPUs have a deep hierarchical memory of different types as well as different configurations of these memories. Performance prediction of applications executed on these devices is a great challenge and is essential for the efficient use of resources in machines with these co-processors. There are different approaches for these predictions, such as analytical modeling and machine learning techniques. In this thesis, we present an analysis and characterization of the performance of applications executed on GPUs. We propose a simple and intuitive BSP-based model for predicting the CUDA application execution times on different GPUs. The model is based on the number of computations and memory accesses of the GPU, with additional information on cache usage obtained from profiling. We also compare three different Machine Learning (ML) approaches: Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests with BSP-based analytical model. This comparison is made in two contexts, first, data input or features for ML techniques were the same than analytical model, and, second, using a process of feature extraction, using correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering. We show that GPU applications that scale regularly can be predicted with simple analytical models, and an adjusting parameter. This parameter can be used to predict these applications in other GPUs. We also demonstrate that ML approaches provide reasonable predictions for different cases and ML techniques required no detailed knowledge of application code, hardware characteristics or explicit modeling. Consequently, whenever a large data set with information about similar applications are available or it can be created, ML techniques can be useful for deploying automated on-line performance prediction for scheduling applications on heterogeneous architectures with GPUs.\n",

      "Author:  Oliveira, Guilherme Werneck de (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The Internet of Things (IoT) has undergone a rapid popularization, reaching a wide range of application domains. As a consequence, more and more IoT devices with diverse characteristics are deployed in a variety of public and private environments, progressively becoming common objects of everyday life. On the other hand, the physical infrastructure of heterogeneous systems is complex and requires efficient and dynamic solutions for managing network performance and security, at a level that allows standardized deployment and easy replication in smart industries, buildings and cities. An approach that has been gaining ground when the intention is to respond to security threats on IoT is the Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) usage. The literature presents some works that use NFV to detect and mitigate security threats on IoT networks, but few performance indicators of the network context are explored to compose a more efficient solution. Thus, this work presents the development of a network context performance-based approach to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on IoT, investigating how performance indicators can compose Machine Learning (ML) models for Virtual Network Functions (VNF) placement. ML models were trained and tested using network context performance indicators to carry out two experiments. The first is related to the prediction of the response time of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. The second on the security VNF placement, also on IIoT networks. The respective results achieved are predictions of network response times that are at most 50 milliseconds longer than settings realized by linear programming models and classifications with 99.40% of accuracy for the correct placement of security VNF on IIoT networks under DDoS attacks.\n",

      "Author:  Gueleri, Roberto Alves (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Machine learning consists of concepts and techniques that enable computers to improve their performance with experience, i.e., learn from data. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning are important categories of machine learning, which respectively consists of inferring patterns in datasets whose data have no label (class) and classifying data in partially-labeled datasets. Although intensively studied, machine learning is still a field full of challenges and with many open topics. Collective dynamical systems, in turn, are systems made of a large group of individuals, each one a dynamical system by itself, such that all of them behave collectively, i.e., the action of each individual is influenced by the action of its neighbors. A remarkable feature of those systems is that global patterns may spontaneously emerge from the local interactions among individuals, a phenomenon known as emergence. Their relevance and intrinsic challenges motivate research in various branches of science and engineering. In this doctorate research, we develop and analyze collective dynamical models for their usage in machine-learning tasks, specifically unsupervised and semi-supervised ones. Image segmentation and network community detection are also addressed, as they are related to machine learning as well. In particular, we propose to work on models in which the objects motion is determined by the location and velocity of their neighbors. By doing so, the dynamical system reaches a configuration in which the patterns developed by the set of individuals highlight underlying patterns of the dataset. Due to their self-organizing nature, it is also expected that the models can be robust and the information generated during the process (values of the system variables) can be rich and reveal, for example, features to perform soft labeling and determine overlapping classes.\n",

      "Abstract:  The segment of computer games called Massively Multiplayer Online, in which thousands of people can be connected simultaneously, are taken as examples of current collective games. From the analysis of Michel Foucault's biopolitics, are investigated the identity constructions of individuals, social roles and commitments with other players and the learning and disciplines reinforced in such games, with reference to the game World of Warcraft, the most popular of this genre, today. The fieldwork was carried out with players and with the official websites of the selected game, through which the regimes of truths that concern us here. Cyberculture is understood in this work as a condition of social engineering that reconfigures the distances and the physical and temporal boundaries, reinforcing ways of subjection ever more individualized and referenced by speeches of sprawling groups. The type of game considered in this work, in addition to become popular by employing tools and practices peculiar to the new electronic technologies, favors the analysis that the forms of government and control over life are increasingly refined, overflowing by all planes of existence. Such analysis allows the questioning of scientific discourse, mainly in the last decade, about practices among subjects involving games, and mainly when referring to practices in education and learning.\n",

      "Abstract:  The use of computers to automatically perform operational tasks is commonplace, thanks to the information technology evolution. The maintenance of computer systems, on the other hand, is commonly performed manually, resulting in high costs, low productivity and low quality of service. The Autonomous Computing initiative aims to approach this limitation, through selfmanagement of computer systems. In order to assemble a fully autonomous system, an intrusion detection application is needed to monitor the behavior and data flows on applications. Considering this context, an autonomous Web intrusion detection system is proposed, based on machine-learning techniques with near-linear computational complexity. This system is based on clustering and novelty detection techniques, characterizing an application behavior, to later pinpoint anomalies in live applications. By conducting experiments, we observed that this new approach is capable of detecting anomalies with less dependency on specific contexts than previous solutions\n",

As a result, those companies started to develop or acquire reusable solutions. This study shows the application of reuse in games and, as a conclusion, it demonstrates how design patterns can contribute in a project of computer games, focusing on the development of the software core that composes them, called game engine. In order to facilitate the maintenance and evolution of the system, this device should be modular and extensible, beyond other characteristics discussed in this text. It is also presented the definition of a game engine, specifying the modules that compile it, describing, after that, the design patterns and their applications. As an experiment, it is analyzed the use of design patterns in already existing game engines, making use of the ones that are open source or that are available in the literature. In this experiment, it is emphasized the abstraction of the graphical API, pointing out the positive and negative aspects of each solution. Based on this analysis, it is proposed a solution which aims to fulfill the requirements considered relevant in a game engine.\n",

      "Author:  Cacho, Carlos Emílio de Andrade (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The teaching of computer science involves many subjects that form the basis for an effective learning. The lack of adequate educational resources makes difficult to present such subjects clearly, due to the dynamics and complexity of them. The teaching of subjects related to the content of memory hierarchy and virtual memory are challenging, because both present distinct aspects, such as: structural, functional and performance. Many approaches have been studied to make the teaching of these aspects more attractive. One of these approaches considers the development and application of Open Educational Resources (OER). OER have been successfully applied to help the teaching and learning of challenging issues. Even knowing the possibility of using OER, many contents do not use such resources. This work presents the transformation of the Amnesia simulator in an OER to make easier the teaching and learning of the virtual memory subject, simulating structural, functional and performance aspects. The focus of this work is to improve the Virtual Memory teaching with the help of the OER Amnesia. We developed teaching materials to help teachers and students with class plans, tutorial of utilization and text with theoretical content, which are available along with the OER Amnesia. In order to verify the improvement in teaching and learning were conducted three experiments with undergraduate and graduate students, applying quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The experiments followed a similar experimental basis, but each experiment had its particularity in the application and analysis of results. The experiments show a considerable progress in the subject virtual memory learning among the students. In the first experiment, it was possible to observe a 28.8% of improvement in the quantity of hits by students. In the second experiment it was possible to compare results of students who used the OER Amnesia with students who had no class between the two tests applied. The results of the third experiment show improvements of up to 180% in the amount of hits, when using Amnesia, for those students with difficulties (demonstrated in their notes), where the use of Amnesia was more significant.\n",

      "Abstract:  This work presents the results of research and application of GPGPU (General-Purpose computation on Graphics Processing Units) techniques on the video-avatar system with augmented reality called AVMix. With increasing demand for interactive three-dimensional graphics rendered in real-time and closer to reality, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) evolved to the present state as a high-powered computing hardware enabled to process parallel algorithms over a large data set. This way, it is possible to use this capability to increase the performance of algorithms used in several areas, such as image processing and computer vision. From the research of similar work, it is possible to define the use of CUDA (Computer Unified Device Architecture) from Nvidia, which facilitates the implementation of the programs that run on GPU and at the same time flexibilize its use, exposing to the programmer some details of hardware such as the number of processors allocated and the different types of memory. Following the reimplementation of critical performance routines of AVMix system (depth map, segmentation and interaction), the results show the viability of using the GPU to process parallel algorithms in this application and the importance of evaluating the algorithm to be implemented, considering the complexity of the calculation and the volume of data transferred between the GPU and the computer's main memory.\n",

      "Abstract:  Virtual Machines have gained great importance with advent of multi-core processors (on platform x86) and with low cost of hardware parts, like physical memory. Due to this computational power improvement a new challenge to take advantage of idle resources has been created. The virtualization technology, even being an old concept became popular in research centers and corporations. With this technology idle resources now can be exploited. This work has the objective to show the main techniques to manage computational resources in virtual environments. Although many of current concepts used in Virtual Machine Monitors project has been ported, with minimal changes, from conventional Operating Systems there are some resources that are difficult to virtualize with efficiency due to old paradigms still present in Operating Systems projects. Finally, the Memory Dispatcher (MD) is presented, a mechanism used to memory management. The main objective of MD is to improve the memory share among Virtual Machines. This mechanism was developed in C and it was tested in Xen Virtual Machine Monitor. The MD showed memory gains up to 70%.\n",

      "Author:  Bueno, André Amaro (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Kernel based methods are capable of solving nonlinear problems by projecting the input vectors in a higher dimensional space where a linear method is used. These methods have been widely used in conjunction with different techniques of signal processing and machine learning, as support vector machines, principal component analysis, adaptive filtering among others. One of the main drawbacks of these methods is that a set of input vectors, known as dictionary, needs to be stored in memory. In certain situations, the dictionary may become too big, which leads to a high computational cost. To avoid an exagerated growth of the dictionary, different sparsification techniques were proposed in the literature. In this work, we propose a sparsification technique for kernel methods based on the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process. It projects the vectors mapped by the kernel into a finite-dimensional subspace spanned by an orthonormal basis and can be used with any Mercer kernel. In particular, the proposed technique is applied to a least-mean-square-type (LMS) algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm mantains a good mean-square-error performance and presents a smaller computational cost, when compared with the kernel LMS algorithm using other sparsification techniques. Furthermore, we also propose a method for removing vectors from the dictionary, which is particularly interesting when there are changes the environment where the algorithm is used.\n",

      "Author:  Pereira, João Paulo Aragão (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The quality of service offered by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) depends directly on the amount of resources available at that time. In recent decades, this quality has been affected by the frequent and intense attacks that consume these resources, such as the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In order to make the ISPs network more resilient to different types of DDoS attacks, techniques have been developed against such attacks over the past few years. Aiming to contribute to the improvement of such mechanisms, this dissertation presents a reactive autonomous method for detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks using a Multi-Agent system (MAS), in networks of ISPs. The main property of the proposed method is to identify characteristic traffic patterns of an attack, such as a large stream of packets directed to a service or equipment within the ISP network. With agents positioned on likely victims and at points of the network with the highest packet stream, the mitigation process starts automatically after a number of packets exceeding the traffic pattern, go through any of the monitored nodes. Since the incoming traffic on the network of any ISP is dynamic, whether legitimate or malicious, the using of agents tends to facilitate the process of defining the route of attack, as shown by the experimental results obtained with the proposed system.\n",

      "Author:  Almeida, Thiago Rodrigues Meira de (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Distributed attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) ones, require not only the deployment of standalone security mechanisms responsible for monitoring a limited portion of the network, but also distributed mechanisms which are able to jointly detect and mitigate the attack before the complete exhaustion of network resources. This need led to the proposal of several collaborative security mechanisms, covering different phases of the attack mitigation: from its detection to the relief of the system after the attack subsides. It is expected that such mechanisms enable the collaboration among security nodes through the distributed enforcement of security policies, either by installing security rules (e.g., for packet filtering) and/or by provisioning new specialized security nodes on the network. Albeit promising, existing proposals that distribute security tasks among collaborative nodes usually do not consider an optimal allocation of computational resources. As a result, their operation may result in a poor Quality of Service for legitimate packet flows during the mitigation of a DDoS attack. Aiming to tackle this issue, this work proposes a collaborative solution against DDoS attacks with two main goals: (1) ensure an optimal use of resources already available in the attack's datapath in a proactive way, and (2) optimize the placement of security tasks among the collaborating security nodes. Regardless the characteristics of each main goal, legitimate traffic must be preserved as packet loss is reduced as much as possible.\n",

Thus, this work presents the development of a network context performance-based approach to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on IoT, investigating how performance indicators can compose Machine Learning (ML) models for Virtual Network Functions (VNF) placement. ML models were trained and tested using network context performance indicators to carry out two experiments. The first is related to the prediction of the response time of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. The second on the security VNF placement, also on IIoT networks. The respective results achieved are predictions of network response times that are at most 50 milliseconds longer than settings realized by linear programming models and classifications with 99.40% of accuracy for the correct placement of security VNF on IIoT networks under DDoS attacks.\n",

      "Author:  Faria, Gerson de Souza (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  This thesis presents three new attacks on electronic payment equipment having mechanical keypads, known as \"PIN pads\". We show in three different ways how they have security vulnerabilities at the physical layer allowing the leak of the PIN (Personal Identification Number) when it is entered. We experimentally demonstrated that it is possible to infer with high success rate (100% in one of the attacks) the password entered on the device, in a non-invasive way. The attacks are based on the placement of sensors inside the equipment itself or in its operating environment: accelerometers for doing vibration analysis, microphones for acoustic analysis and load cells for measuring the pressing force. Due to massive deployment of sensors in consumer devices, information theft by unconventional means is increasing. The results of the low-cost attacks here developed expose serious shortcomings in the process of security certification of such equipment.\n",

      "Author:  Moraes, João Marcos Meneghel de (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Two experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance and rumen parameters of Nellore males fed feedlot finishing diets with varying levels of dried distillers bran plus solubles (DDBS). All diets were formulated to be isoprotein containing 8.5% sugarcane bagasse, 12% soybean hulls, 0.5 to 1.4% urea and 1.8% mineral and vitamin supplements. The treatments were (% of DM): 0% (64% of corn, 8% of cottonseed, 5% of soybean meal and 64% of ground corn; 15% (15% of DDBS, 61.3% of ground corn), 30% (30% DDBS and 46.7% ground corn) and 45% (45% DDBS and 32.2% ground corn). Nelore bulls (399 kg) were distributed in 56 pens in a randomized block design and fed for 98 days, after 21 days of adaptation. Dry matter intake (P=0.005), daily weight gain (P=0.002), feed efficiency (P<0.001), hot carcass weight (P=0.005), diet net energy of maintenance (P<0.001) and net energy of gain (P<0.001) were increased linearly. The other parameters evaluated such as carcass yield, loin eye area and fat thickness were not affected by inclusion of DDBS in the diet (P>0.05). In the metabolism study, 28 Nellore steers cannulated in the rumen were allotted to individual pens in a randomized block design. The inclusion of DDBS in the diet caused a quadratic reduction in rumen isobutirate (P=0.005) and a linear reduction in isovalerate (P=0.015) while the intakes of DM, NFC, GE and DE presented a quadratic response (P≤0,03), with the highest values at 15% of inclusion. In summary, the DDBS used in this trial contains greater energy value than the different replaced combinations of flint corn, whole cottonseed and soybean meal, and its inclusion up to 45% of diet DM improves the performance of finishing cattle.\n",

      "Author:  Pereira, João Paulo Aragão (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The quality of service offered by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) depends directly on the amount of resources available at that time. In recent decades, this quality has been affected by the frequent and intense attacks that consume these resources, such as the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In order to make the ISPs network more resilient to different types of DDoS attacks, techniques have been developed against such attacks over the past few years. Aiming to contribute to the improvement of such mechanisms, this dissertation presents a reactive autonomous method for detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks using a Multi-Agent system (MAS), in networks of ISPs. The main property of the proposed method is to identify characteristic traffic patterns of an attack, such as a large stream of packets directed to a service or equipment within the ISP network. With agents positioned on likely victims and at points of the network with the highest packet stream, the mitigation process starts automatically after a number of packets exceeding the traffic pattern, go through any of the monitored nodes. Since the incoming traffic on the network of any ISP is dynamic, whether legitimate or malicious, the using of agents tends to facilitate the process of defining the route of attack, as shown by the experimental results obtained with the proposed system.\n",

      "Author:  Nishimoto, Bruno Eidi (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Dialogue system (DS) is an old idea dating back to 1966, when the rst such system was created. DS can be classied in three categories: question & answering, task-oriented and socialbot. Task-oriented dialogue systems are a very relevant eld due to the diversity of possible applications it can achieve. For example, it can solve tasks like buying a movie ticket, booking a restaurant and providing customer service. They have received increasing attention in recent years, and one reason for this is the advancement in natural language processing. Although the literature presents several studies focusing on DS, there are still many issues to be accomplished. Most of them are related to dialogue management, the central component of DS. Reinforcement learning (RL) is one approach that has achieved great success recently. However, things become more complex when DS is extended to multi-domain settings, i.e. when DS needs to complete multiple tasks in dierent domains for the user. Some problems such as policy adaptation and transfer learning arise in this new scenario. The purpose of this research is to improve recent techniques using RL on the dialogue management. We present an ecient learning by balancing exploration and exploitation, and enhancing the usage of expert knowledge to guide the agent. We propose a method to handle noise and error in the input of the dialogue management and we also provide a basic comparison between RL and supervised learning in both toy and real datasets. Finally, we present a new proposal to deal with multi-domain settings: the use of the divide-and-conquer technique and transfer learning for dierent domains.\n",

      "Author:  Chesini, Rodrigo Garavaglia (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Adequate dietary balance, including the balance of rumen degradable protein (RDP) and rumen undegradable protein (RUP), can increase milk production and reduce nitrogen losses to the environment. The objective of this study was to evaluate different protein sources in diets of lactating cows and their effects on intake and total apparent digestibility of dry matter and nutrients, milk production and composition, microbial protein synthesis, blood metabolites, nitrogen balance , sorting index, body weight and body condition score. Twenty-four multiparous Holstein cows, with 200 ± 40.0 days in lactation (DIM), 599 ± 78.0 kg of body weight (BW) and 30.0 ± 3.92 L of milk production were used. The animals were distributed into a 3 × 3 Latin square experimental design, receiving the following treatments: 1) CON., with soybean meal as the major protein source in concentrate; 2) SOY., 30% partial replacement of soybean meal with toasted soybean meal (Soypass®, Cargill, São Paulo); 3) DDGS, 30% partial replacement of soybean meal with dry distillers grains with solubles (FLEXYPRO®, Cargill, São Paulo). The diets were formulated according to the NRC (2001) with a roughage to concentrate ratio of 48:52. Each experimental period lasted 21 days, with 14 days of adaptation and 07 days of data collection and sampling. Regarding nutrient intake, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), crude protein (CP) and ether extract (EE), there was a significant difference (P ≤ 0.05) when comparing the CON treatment. vs. (SOY vs. DDGS). Regarding the two alternative protein sources, there was a significant difference for the consumption of NDF, EE and NDF (kg/d and % PV) between the SOY vs DDGS treatments. (P ≤ 0.05). Selection Sorting index was different when comparing CON vs. PNDR sources, on the 8 4 mm and < 4 mm sieve (P ≤ 0.05). The same happens when comparing the same group of sieves in SOY vs. DDGS, (P ≤ 0.05). The combination SOY and DDGS significantly affected milk production and lactose production (kg/d), when compared to the control treatment (P ≤ 0.05). The same treatments (SOY and/or DDGS) tended to increase milk production corrected for energy and protein (P ≤ 0.099). The DDGS treatment showed a significant increase (P = 0.010) in milk protein content when compared to the SOY group. Even the body weight of animals between treatments showed a significant difference (P = 0.039). Regarding the nitrogen balance, there was a significant difference in the total N consumed (P = 0.026) of the RUP sources. Alternative protein sources tended to increase (P ≤ 0.082) N excreted in feces and milk. However, it can be concluded that the use of PNDR sources can be added to dairy cows diets and provide satisfactory results.\n",

Therefore, its resolution does not necessarily happen in the same locality where it was practiced. Draws attention to the fact that the principles that delimit the validity of the penal law might not be sufficient to dispel possible conflicts of jurisdiction, if interpreted in the usual traditional way. By giving examples, it analyses and classifies types of electronic crimes as well as the criminal agents of the digital age. Gathers and comments laws and projects of law, both national and international, as well as conventions on electronic crimes. Finally, it presents criteria of solution for resolving the conflict of jurisdiction for crimes practiced in cyberspace, suggesting, of lege ferenda, the pursuit of a law which would eliminate such conflicts.\n",

      "Abstract:  Distributed attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) ones, require not only the deployment of standalone security mechanisms responsible for monitoring a limited portion of the network, but also distributed mechanisms which are able to jointly detect and mitigate the attack before the complete exhaustion of network resources. This need led to the proposal of several collaborative security mechanisms, covering different phases of the attack mitigation: from its detection to the relief of the system after the attack subsides. It is expected that such mechanisms enable the collaboration among security nodes through the distributed enforcement of security policies, either by installing security rules (e.g., for packet filtering) and/or by provisioning new specialized security nodes on the network. Albeit promising, existing proposals that distribute security tasks among collaborative nodes usually do not consider an optimal allocation of computational resources. As a result, their operation may result in a poor Quality of Service for legitimate packet flows during the mitigation of a DDoS attack. Aiming to tackle this issue, this work proposes a collaborative solution against DDoS attacks with two main goals: (1) ensure an optimal use of resources already available in the attack's datapath in a proactive way, and (2) optimize the placement of security tasks among the collaborating security nodes. Regardless the characteristics of each main goal, legitimate traffic must be preserved as packet loss is reduced as much as possible.\n",

      "Author:  Ronqui, José Ricardo Furlan (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Centrality measures were developed to evaluate the importance of nodes and links based on the structure of networks. Centralities are essential in the study of networks because these systems are usually large, which make manual analysis of all nodes and links impossible; therefore recognizing such elements is a vital task. As nodes and links can be considered essential by different reasons, a large number of measures were proposed to identify important elements that were not highlighted by the other ones. In our study, we use Pearson's correlation coefficient to measure the similarity between rankings of nodes and links provided by different centralities for real and model based networks. We also perform attacks to networks, using these rankings to determine the order of removal of nodes and links, intending to evaluate and compare the efficiency and how the systems react to attacks guided by different centralities. Finally, we use the correlation coefficients between the pairs of centralities as properties of networks, and perform a principal component analysis with them, to evaluate if differences among network structures can be detected from correlations. Our results showed that centrality measures are frequently correlated, which means that the same elements can be highlighted by different centralities. We also noticed that the correlation coefficients are larger in models than in real world networks. The results of the attacks experiment showed that even when two measures are highly correlated, they can affect networks in distinct ways, meaning that the group of the nodes and links provided by each measure are relevant for the study of networks systems. Our last result evidenced that correlations among centrality measures can be used for characterization of networks and to evaluate how well models represent them.\n",

From the analysis of Michel Foucault's biopolitics, are investigated the identity constructions of individuals, social roles and commitments with other players and the learning and disciplines reinforced in such games, with reference to the game World of Warcraft, the most popular of this genre, today. The fieldwork was carried out with players and with the official websites of the selected game, through which the regimes of truths that concern us here. Cyberculture is understood in this work as a condition of social engineering that reconfigures the distances and the physical and temporal boundaries, reinforcing ways of subjection ever more individualized and referenced by speeches of sprawling groups. The type of game considered in this work, in addition to become popular by employing tools and practices peculiar to the new electronic technologies, favors the analysis that the forms of government and control over life are increasingly refined, overflowing by all planes of existence. Such analysis allows the questioning of scientific discourse, mainly in the last decade, about practices among subjects involving games, and mainly when referring to practices in education and learning.\n",

This architecture is structured of such way that the classifications obtained through a specific technique can be reutilized in parallel by the same algorithm or by other techniques, producing new classifications through the refinement of the results achieved and expanding the use in databases with different characteristics. The system was structured in four parts denominated, respectively, Initialization module; Validation module; Refinement module; and Especial scheduling module. In each module, various algorithms can be employed to reach its objectives. The structure of this system allows its configuration, utilizing various methods, including artificial intelligence techniques. Thus, it is possible to obtain more precise results through the choice of the best method to each case. The results presented in this work were obtained from basis that are known in the literature, which allows to compare the implementations of the traditional methods that were added to the system and, especially, to verify the quality of the refinements produced by the integration of different techniques. The results demonstrated that through a learning system, the complexity of the analysis of great databases is minimized, allowing to verify basis with different structures and to increase the methods applied in the analysis of each structure. It favors the comparison between the methodologies and provides more reliable results. To standardize the data originated of distinct bases, the data modelling system was elaborated, which will favor the uniform scalability of the system.\n",

      "Author:  Muyal, Thomas Araújo (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Artificial neural networks are a group of artificial intelligence algorithms widely used contemporarily in the industry and research, implemented to solve a great variety of issues. Its recent popularity is in part due to the advance of hardware technologies, which provide computational resources for the resource-intensive processing necessary for its implementation. Historically, neural network software is executed in Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are general purpose devices. However, metrics such as inference speed, energy efficiency and circuit area are improved with the use of specialized hardware accelerators. In the context of edge computing, the processing on location of data gathered by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there are significant restrictions as to those metrics. One of the devices frequently used for this purpose are Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which offer integrated circuits whose functionality may be programmed for the synthesis of hardware specialized in specific algorithms, offering high performance and execution efficiency, as well as other benefits such as being able to be reconfigured after manufacturing, shorter design cycles, faster time-to-market and lower cost than the alternatives. One of the issues for the use of FPGAs is that its programming is difficult and requires specialist knowledge to fully make use of these devices characteristics, and not every team of artificial intelligence developers has such knowledge. Consequently, there is interest in systems that automatize the synthesis of neural network hardware accelerators in FPGAs, to bring the benefits of this technique to a wider audience. Another approach to solve the high restriction environment of edge computing is neural network quantization, which means reducing the precision of representation of parameters so they consume less memory, and operations using these numbers are faster. This work studies the state of the art of this manner of software, diagnosing existing gaps. The main objective of this research is the creation and validation of a proof of concept of automatic generation of neural network hardware accelerators that are using parameter quantization techniques to enable its synthesis on small FPGAs aimed towards edge computing. For the validation of this system, an accelerator was generated and its behavior was measured in metrics of latency, end result throughput, energy efficiency, circuit area and compared to the execution of the same neural network in a high-end personal computer CPU. The results indicate that the generated hardware accelerator is synthesizeable, significantly faster and consumes considerably less energy than the CPU implementation.\n",

      "Author:  Verri, Filipe Alves Neto (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Machine learning enables machines to learn automatically from data. In literature, graph-based methods have received increasing attention due to their ability to learn from both local and global information. In these methods, each data instance is represented by a vertex and is linked to other vertices according to a predefined affinity rule. However, they usually have unfeasible time cost for large problems. To overcome this problem, techniques can employ a heuristic to find suboptimal solutions in a feasible time. Early heuristic optimization methods exploit nature-inspired collective processes, such as ants looking for food sources and swarms of bees. Nowadays, advances in the field of complex systems provide powerful tools to assess and to understand dynamical systems. Complex networks, which are graphs with nontrivial topology, are among these theoretical tools capable of describing the interplay of topology, structure, and dynamics of complex systems. Therefore, machine learning methods based on complex networks and collective dynamics have been proposed. They encompass three steps. First, a complex network is constructed from the input data. Then, the simulation of a distributed collective system in the network generates rich information. Finally, the collected information is used to solve the learning problem. The coordination of the individuals in the system permit to achieve dynamics that is far more complex than the behavior of single individuals. In this research, I have explored collective dynamics in machine learning tasks, both in unsupervised and semi-supervised scenarios. Specifically, I have proposed a new collective system of competing particles that shifts the traditional vertex-centric dynamics to a more informative edge-centric one. Moreover, it is the first particle competition system applied in machine learning task that has deterministic behavior. Results show several advantages of the edge-centric model, including the ability to acquire more information about overlapping areas, a better exploration behavior, and a faster convergence time. Also, I have proposed a new network formation technique that is not based on similarity and has low computational cost. Since addition and removal of samples in the network is cheap, it can be used in real-time application. Finally, I have conducted analytical investigations of a flocking-like system that was needed to guarantee the expected behavior in community detection tasks. In conclusion, the result of the research contributes to many areas of machine learning and complex systems.\n",

On the other hand, the physical infrastructure of heterogeneous systems is complex and requires efficient and dynamic solutions for managing network performance and security, at a level that allows standardized deployment and easy replication in smart industries, buildings and cities. An approach that has been gaining ground when the intention is to respond to security threats on IoT is the Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) usage. The literature presents some works that use NFV to detect and mitigate security threats on IoT networks, but few performance indicators of the network context are explored to compose a more efficient solution. Thus, this work presents the development of a network context performance-based approach to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on IoT, investigating how performance indicators can compose Machine Learning (ML) models for Virtual Network Functions (VNF) placement. ML models were trained and tested using network context performance indicators to carry out two experiments. The first is related to the prediction of the response time of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. The second on the security VNF placement, also on IIoT networks. The respective results achieved are predictions of network response times that are at most 50 milliseconds longer than settings realized by linear programming models and classifications with 99.40% of accuracy for the correct placement of security VNF on IIoT networks under DDoS attacks.\n",

      "Author:  Vallim, Rosane Maria Maffei (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  One of the challenges of Artificial Intelligence applied to games is behavior learning, where the objective is to use statistics derived from the interaction between the player and the game environment in order to recognize particular player characteristics or to monitor the evolution of a players behavior along time. The majority of work developed in this area applies models that were previously learned through the use of Machine Learning techniques. However, only a few pieces of work consider that the players behavior can evolve over time and, therefore, recognizing when behavior changes happen is the first step towards the production of games that adapt to the players needs. In order to detect changes in the behavior of a player, incremental algorithms are necessary, what motivates the study of change detection algorithms from the area of Data Stream Mining. However, some of the characteristics of the algorithms available in the literature make their application to the task of change detection in games unfeasible. To overcome these difficulties, this work proposes two new approaches for change detection. The first approach is based on an incremental clustering and novelty detection algorithm which is independent of the number and format of clusters and uses a mechanism for change detection based on sliding windows. The second approach, on the other hand, is based on the comparison of consecutive time windows using spectrograms created from the data inside each window. Experimental results using simulations and data from commercial games indicate the applicability of the proposed algorithms in the task of detecting a players changing behavior, as well as present their advantage when compared to other change detection algorithms available in the literature\n",

      "Abstract:  Active semi-supervised learning can play an important role in classification scenarios in which labeled data are laborious and/or expensive to obtain, while unlabeled data are numerous and can be easily acquired. There are many active algorithms in the literature and this work focuses on an active semi-supervised algorithm that can be driven by clustering hierarchy, the well-known Hierarchical Sampling (HS) algorithm. This work takes as a starting point the original Hierarchical Sampling algorithm and perform changes in different aspects of the original algorithm in order to tackle its main drawbacks, including its sensitivity to the choice of a single particular hierarchy. Experimental results over many real datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs superior or competitive when compared to a number of state-of-the-art algorithms for active semi-supervised classification.\n",

      "Abstract:  Complex networks is a recent and active scientific research field, which concerns large scale networks with non-trivial topological structure, such as computer networks, telecommunication networks, transport networks, social networks and biological networks. Many of these networks are naturally divided into communities or modules and, therefore, uncovering their structure is one of the main problems related to complex networks study. This problem is related with the machine learning field, which is concerned with the design and development of algorithms and techniques which allow computers to learn, or increase their performance based on experience. Some of the problems identified in traditional learning techniques include: difficulties in identifying irregular forms in the attributes space; uncovering overlap structures of groups or classes, which occurs when elements belong to more than one group or class; and the high computational complexity of some models, which prevents their application in larger data bases. In this work, we deal with these problems through the development of new machine learning models using complex networks and space-temporal dynamics. The developed models have performance similar to those from some state-of-the-art algorithms, at the same time that they present lower computational complexity order than most of them\n",

      "Abstract:  Growth in the Information and Communication Technology sector is increasing the need to improve the quality of service and energy efficiency, as this industry has already surpassed 12% of global energy consumption in 2017. Data centers correspond to a large part of this consumption, accounting for about 15% of energy expenditure on the Information and Communication Technology domain; moreover, the subsystem that generates the most costs for data center operators is that of servers and storage. Many solutions have been proposed to reduce server consumption, such as the use of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, a technology that enables the adaptation of energy consumption to the workload by modifying the operating voltage and frequency, although they are not optimized for network traffic. In this thesis, a control method was developed using a prediction engine based on the analysis of the ongoing traffic. Machine learning algorithms based on Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines have been used, and it was verified that it is possible to reduce power consumption by up to 12% on servers with Intel Sandy Bridge processor and up to 21 % in servers with Intel Haswell processor when compared to the maximum frequency, which is currently the most used solution in the industry.\n",

      "Abstract:  As a result of a higher life expectancy, the high probability of natural accidents and traumas occurences entails an increasing need for rehabilitation. Physical therapy, under the robotic rehabilitation paradigm with serious games, offers the patient better motivation and engagement to the treatment, being a method recommended by American Heart Association (AHA), pointing the highest assessment (Level A) for inpatients and outpatients. However, the rich potential of the data analysis provided by robotic devices is poorly exploited, discarding the opportunity to aggregate valuable information to treatments. The aim of this work consists of applying knowledge discovery techniques by classifying the performance of patients diagnosed with chronic hemiparesis. The patients, inserted into a robotic rehabilitation environment, exercised with the InMotion ARM, a robotic device for upper-limb rehabilitation which also does the collection of performance data. A Knowledge Discovery roadmap was applied over collected data in order to preprocess, transform and perform data mining through machine learning methods. The strategy of this work culminated in a pattern classification with the abilty to distinguish hemiparetic sides with an accuracy rate of 94%, having eight attributes feeding the input of the obtained mechanism. The interpretation of these attributes has shown that force-related data are more significant, comprising half of the composition of a sample.\n",

      "Author:  Dias, Marcelo (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Glaucoma is an optical neuropathy, whose progression results in visual eld impairments and blindness. Due to its irreversible damages, early and correct identication is very important to control glaucoma's progression. For glaucoma diagnosis, ophthalmologists analyze patient's visual eld and eyes structural data obtained by using eyes' test equipments. In order to reduce the quantity of false-negative and false-positive results, several new techniques have been developed to increment the sensitivity and specicity of glaucoma diagnostic tests. A promising approach is the use of machine learning classiers. Classiers based on dierent concepts like Decision Trees, Articial Neural Networks, and Bayesian approach, have been developed for medical applications. Despite the availability of sophisticated algorithms for classiers development, successful training of classiers is highly dependent of good training data. Good data means that examples provided for classier training should represent the many dierent situations found in real world. These requirements are usually accomplished if data from a large number of patients is available. However, several factors like prole of evaluated population, duration of the data acquisition activities, existence of healthcare professionals, and equipment availability, and people's commitment to the research program, restrict the size of patient's dataset. A possible approach to overcome the lack of patient's data to perform the classier's training task is to use articial data that represent a real population. This articial data would be suitable for classiers training if it has similar statistical properties of a real population. The use of articial population will enable the creation of datasets with required number of patients, and without spending years measuring patients. It will also be possible to simulate scenarios and strategies before a long term research program starts. In this work is presented an articial data generator named GLOR, based on a Monte Carlo method, and suitable for the training of classiers for glaucoma diagnosis. The generated population is characterized by eyes'functional and structural data provided by Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP) and High Denition Optical Coherence Tomography (HD-OCT) instruments. The experimental results, obtained after an Articial Neural Network training employing a population generated by GLOR comprising of 4500 normal and 500 glaucomatous individuals and evaluated by using real population data from 44 normal and 26 glaucomatous subjects, were: 87.1% for overall accuracy, 80.8% for sensitivity, 90.9% for specicity and 0.941 for the area under ROC curve. These results show that GLOR can be used as a promising approach to accelerate the development of new methods to increment sensitivity and specicity of glaucoma diagnosis.\n",

      "Abstract:  Chaotic behaviour can be observed in the most diverse systems, including planetary orbits, weather, stock market and so on. Therefore, investigating means to predict the future of chaotic systems can help us comprehend many systems that surround us. The Logistic Map, originally proposed as a model to describe a population growth, presents sensitivity to initial conditions, which leads to the unpredictability of the future of this system. It is one of the most famous examples of chaotic behaviour emerging from a simple dynamical system. In this study, the chaotic orbits of the logistic map were chosen because of both their simplicity and wide range of complexity. Neural networks are the current most popular approach to machine learning and have achieved state-of-the art results in many different tasks. Recurrent Neural Networks are able to recollect previous inputs, they are therefore more suitable to handle sequential data. In this dissertation, two types of recurrent neural networks were used to investigate how they predict future terms of chaotic orbits from the Logistic Map: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Echo State Networks (ESN). The results obtained show that ESNs are able to predict these orbits with higher accuracy than LSTMs and confirm them as promising tool to challenge the unpredictability of chaos.\n",

      "Author:  Cupertino, Thiago Henrique (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Extracting useful knowledge from data sets is a key concept in modern information systems. Consequently, the need of efficient techniques to extract the desired knowledge has been growing over time. Machine learning is a research field dedicated to the development of techniques capable of enabling a machine to \"learn\" from data. Many techniques have been proposed so far, but there are still issues to be unveiled specially in interdisciplinary research. In this thesis, we explore the advantages of network data representation to develop machine learning techniques based on dynamical processes on networks. The network representation unifies the structure, dynamics and functions of the system it represents, and thus is capable of capturing the spatial, topological and functional relations of the data sets under analysis. We develop network-based techniques for the three machine learning paradigms: supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised. The random walk dynamical process is used to characterize the access of unlabeled data to data classes, configuring a new heuristic we call ease of access in the supervised paradigm. We also propose a classification technique which combines the high-level view of the data, via network topological characterization, and the low-level relations, via similarity measures, in a general framework. Still in the supervised setting, the modularity and Katz centrality network measures are applied to classify multiple observation sets, and an evolving network construction method is applied to the dimensionality reduction problem. The semi-supervised paradigm is covered by extending the ease of access heuristic to the cases in which just a few labeled data samples and many unlabeled samples are available. A semi-supervised technique based on interacting forces is also proposed, for which we provide parameter heuristics and stability analysis via a Lyapunov function. Finally, an unsupervised network-based technique uses the concepts of pinning control and consensus time from dynamical processes to derive a similarity measure used to cluster data. The data is represented by a connected and sparse network in which nodes are dynamical elements. Simulations on benchmark data sets and comparisons to well-known machine learning techniques are provided for all proposed techniques. Advantages of network data representation and dynamical processes for machine learning are highlighted in all cases\n",

      "Author:  Nardari, Guilherme Vicentim (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  While overhead data can provide general information about a forest, inside the forest, we can identify understory plants and measure the diameter and count of the trunks of each tree. Currently, specialists rely on human expeditions to get these measurements, which can be slow, expensive, and dangerous. For this reason, robots that can autonomously navigate and extract data from inside the forest could revolutionize how we monitor forests worldwide and the amount of information we have about them. In forestry, the lack of reliable GPS signal, uneven terrain covered by plants and leaves, and trees with branches moving with the wind are a few of the challenges posed. These factors can create shortcomings for classic algorithms as some assumptions may not be valid in this environment. Semantic information, such as classes and forms of objects expected in the environment is a promising way to increase the robustness and performance of autonomous systems. In this context, this thesis introduces a framework that uses 3D data provided by LiDAR or stereo cameras to identify semantic information using neural networks. This information is used to identify trees and model them as cylinders, creating a semantic map. Our formulation allows the incorporation of noisy estimates that can be refined with the arrival of new sensor readings and external measurements to increase the frameworks robustness. Using the semantic map generated by our framework, we propose an algorithm capable of generating unique forest location descriptors that are visually highly similar. These descriptors can be used to identify previously visited locations and feedback to reduce accumulated errors in location estimates. We present several experiments in simulated environments and real-world Pine forests, demonstrating that our method generates semantic maps that improve the quality of the robots location estimates and generate informative maps with information on the individual count and the trunk diameter of each tree. Furthermore, the semantic representation of the data obtained by the sensors is much more computationally efficient, as it summarizes the raw data in a semantic geometric model with few parameters.\n",

      "Author:  Almeida, Thiago Rodrigues Meira de (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Distributed attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) ones, require not only the deployment of standalone security mechanisms responsible for monitoring a limited portion of the network, but also distributed mechanisms which are able to jointly detect and mitigate the attack before the complete exhaustion of network resources. This need led to the proposal of several collaborative security mechanisms, covering different phases of the attack mitigation: from its detection to the relief of the system after the attack subsides. It is expected that such mechanisms enable the collaboration among security nodes through the distributed enforcement of security policies, either by installing security rules (e.g., for packet filtering) and/or by provisioning new specialized security nodes on the network. Albeit promising, existing proposals that distribute security tasks among collaborative nodes usually do not consider an optimal allocation of computational resources. As a result, their operation may result in a poor Quality of Service for legitimate packet flows during the mitigation of a DDoS attack. Aiming to tackle this issue, this work proposes a collaborative solution against DDoS attacks with two main goals: (1) ensure an optimal use of resources already available in the attack's datapath in a proactive way, and (2) optimize the placement of security tasks among the collaborating security nodes. Regardless the characteristics of each main goal, legitimate traffic must be preserved as packet loss is reduced as much as possible.\n",

      "Abstract:  Mechanisms to detect and analyze malicious software are essential to improve security systems. Current security mechanisms have limited success in detecting sophisticated malicious software. More than to evade analysis system, many malware require specific conditions to activate their actions in the target system. The flexibility of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) provides an opportunity to develop a malware analysis architecture that can detect behavioral deviations in an automated way. This thesis presents a specialized architecture to analyze malware by managing the analysis environment in a centralized way, including to control the sandbox and the elements that surrounds it. The proposed architecture enables to determine the network access policy, to handle the analysis environment resource configuration, and to manipulate the network connections performed by the malware. To evaluate our solution we have analyzed a set of malware in two evaluation scenarios. In the first evaluation scenario, we showed that the mechanisms proposed have increased the number of behavioral events in 100% of the malware analyzed. In the second evaluation scenario, we have analyzed malware designed for IoT devices. As a result, by using the MARS features, it was possible to block attacks, to manipulate attack commands, and to enable the malware communication with the respective botnet controller. The experimental results showed that our solution can improve the dynamic malware analysis process by providing this configuration flexibility to the analysis environment.\n",

We experimentally demonstrated that it is possible to infer with high success rate (100% in one of the attacks) the password entered on the device, in a non-invasive way. The attacks are based on the placement of sensors inside the equipment itself or in its operating environment: accelerometers for doing vibration analysis, microphones for acoustic analysis and load cells for measuring the pressing force. Due to massive deployment of sensors in consumer devices, information theft by unconventional means is increasing. The results of the low-cost attacks here developed expose serious shortcomings in the process of security certification of such equipment.\n",

      "Author:  Pereira, João Paulo Aragão (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The quality of service offered by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) depends directly on the amount of resources available at that time. In recent decades, this quality has been affected by the frequent and intense attacks that consume these resources, such as the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In order to make the ISPs network more resilient to different types of DDoS attacks, techniques have been developed against such attacks over the past few years. Aiming to contribute to the improvement of such mechanisms, this dissertation presents a reactive autonomous method for detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks using a Multi-Agent system (MAS), in networks of ISPs. The main property of the proposed method is to identify characteristic traffic patterns of an attack, such as a large stream of packets directed to a service or equipment within the ISP network. With agents positioned on likely victims and at points of the network with the highest packet stream, the mitigation process starts automatically after a number of packets exceeding the traffic pattern, go through any of the monitored nodes. Since the incoming traffic on the network of any ISP is dynamic, whether legitimate or malicious, the using of agents tends to facilitate the process of defining the route of attack, as shown by the experimental results obtained with the proposed system.\n",

      "Abstract:  With the accelerated growth of the complexity of the software and applications that require high performance, hardware and its architecture has undergone a few changes so it could meet that need. One of the proposals and approaches developed to support these applications, was the integration of more than one core processing in a single integrated circuit. Initially, the bus communication architecture was chosen, using for its reuse benefit compared to point-to-point. However, with the cores number increase in Systems-on-Chip (SoC), this approach began to present problems to support internal communication. An alternative that has been explored is the Network-on-Chip (NoC), an approach that proposes to use knowledge of common networks on internal communication projects of SOC. This dissertation focuses is to provide a complete NoC architecture, configurable, customizable and on standard Ethernet. The three NoC basic modules, Network Adapter (NA), Link and Switch, are implemented. The results were obtained using the Stratix IV FPGA. The performance metrics used for NoC validation are silicon area and latency. The available parameters are related to developed modules settings, considering features presented of DSP applications. The experiment using two NA, two cores and one Switch needed 7310 FPGA ALUTs which corresponds to 4% of their logical resources. The time for the transmission of an ethernet frame of 64 Bytes was 422 clock cycles at 50 MHz.\n",

This work explores the use and implementation of Virtual Network Functions (VNFS) in Content-Centric Networks (CCN) and proposes the use of the Named Function Networking (NFN) paradigm as means to implement network functions and services in this kind of networks, distributing the network functions and services through the networks nodes and providing flexibility to dynamically place functions in the network as required and without the need of a central controller. The Dynamic Named Function Architecture (DNFA) was proposed, a scalable and flexible framework that allows the automated deployment, management, monitoring, optimization and lifecycle management of named functions over CCN infrastructures, following the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) NFV architectural guidelines and using an extended customized OASIS TOSCA NFV profile template for VNF meta-data definition. Evaluation of the framework was carried out on a private OpenStack testbed scenario through a DPI VNF implementation.\n",

      "Author:  Oliveira, Guilherme Werneck de (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The Internet of Things (IoT) has undergone a rapid popularization, reaching a wide range of application domains. As a consequence, more and more IoT devices with diverse characteristics are deployed in a variety of public and private environments, progressively becoming common objects of everyday life. On the other hand, the physical infrastructure of heterogeneous systems is complex and requires efficient and dynamic solutions for managing network performance and security, at a level that allows standardized deployment and easy replication in smart industries, buildings and cities. An approach that has been gaining ground when the intention is to respond to security threats on IoT is the Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) usage. The literature presents some works that use NFV to detect and mitigate security threats on IoT networks, but few performance indicators of the network context are explored to compose a more efficient solution. Thus, this work presents the development of a network context performance-based approach to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on IoT, investigating how performance indicators can compose Machine Learning (ML) models for Virtual Network Functions (VNF) placement. ML models were trained and tested using network context performance indicators to carry out two experiments. The first is related to the prediction of the response time of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. The second on the security VNF placement, also on IIoT networks. The respective results achieved are predictions of network response times that are at most 50 milliseconds longer than settings realized by linear programming models and classifications with 99.40% of accuracy for the correct placement of security VNF on IIoT networks under DDoS attacks.\n",

      "Abstract:  With the accelerated growth of the complexity of the software and applications that require high performance, hardware and its architecture has undergone a few changes so it could meet that need. One of the proposals and approaches developed to support these applications, was the integration of more than one core processing in a single integrated circuit. Initially, the bus communication architecture was chosen, using for its reuse benefit compared to point-to-point. However, with the cores number increase in Systems-on-Chip (SoC), this approach began to present problems to support internal communication. An alternative that has been explored is the Network-on-Chip (NoC), an approach that proposes to use knowledge of common networks on internal communication projects of SOC. This dissertation focuses is to provide a complete NoC architecture, configurable, customizable and on standard Ethernet. The three NoC basic modules, Network Adapter (NA), Link and Switch, are implemented. The results were obtained using the Stratix IV FPGA. The performance metrics used for NoC validation are silicon area and latency. The available parameters are related to developed modules settings, considering features presented of DSP applications. The experiment using two NA, two cores and one Switch needed 7310 FPGA ALUTs which corresponds to 4% of their logical resources. The time for the transmission of an ethernet frame of 64 Bytes was 422 clock cycles at 50 MHz.\n",

      "Abstract:  The use of videos in web based laboratories over computer networks, known as weblabs, is being conducted for bee research as part of the ViNCES (Virtual Network Center of Ecosystem Services) project, a research consortium composed by: LAA (Laboratório de Automação Agrícola da Escola Politécnica) and the Laboratório de Abelhas of the Ecology Department of the Biosciences Institute. ViNCES is a member of Kyatera, a high speed academic computer network which aims at developing aplications and technologies for the Advanced Internet. The bee weblab, called BBBee, allows the research and observation of the interior of a beehive, in which are collected climate, audio and video data. Real time audio and video are broadcasted over the Internet and through a local network using streaming format. The bandwidth requirements for video transmission are usually high and the video quality after conventional compression standards is, in general, low and can interfere in the biological research. Also, High-Definition video transmission for weblab is planned to be implemented in order to provide better tools for the researcher, which will demand even higher network bandwidth. On this scenario, this work intends to provide a video codification algorithm to enhance the quality of the transmitted images, at the region of interest, and also reduce the transmission and storage requirements for some situations by using segmentation and tracking techniques for videos. A complete CODEC was implemented and tested with actual video, quality and data rates were measured and evaluated using an objective metric. The results of the analysis provided some indications of directions for future enhancements and implementations.\n",

      "Author:  Fernandes Junior, Renato Ferreira (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The Internet of Things is considered a new communication system that promises to optimize and improve different application areas. It is based on sensor modules and intelligent objects only interconnected through the internet. In large-scale wireless sensor network applications, networks have own specific characteristics such as many low-power, limited-power sensor modules with intermittent communication losses. These networks need to operate with scalable, energy-efficient protocols. Thus, this thesis proposes an asynchronous multichannel receiver-initiated MAC protocol for low power wireless sensor networks and internet of things applications. Through a comparison with already existing solutions, the proposed protocol tries to mitigate message containment and the effect of idle listening through an efficient initial recognition mechanism. It is also proposed an effective diagnosis of communication failure detection in the communication cycle, which also helps to save energy. In addition, a multichannel mechanism is proposed based on the knowledge of the neighborhood channel in addition to services of initialization and maintenance of the network. To validate the proposed protocol, evaluations were made for the consumption of each node sensor, the network traffic for each link, the latency and the network delivery rate in a web application. Tests were performed using asynchronous multichannel receiver-initiated and synchronous protocols based on literature scientific. The results show that the proposed protocol minimizes the energy consumption in relation to the asynchronous protocols, besides improving the communication when compared to the analyzed protocols. In the comparison with the synchronous protocol the proposed protocol showed performance and consumption compatible, when in a smaller duty cycles, and reduced consumption with longer duty cycles.\n",

      "Abstract:  The Internet of Things is considered one of the pillars of the fourth technological revolution that has transformed the way people live, enabling improvements in the quality of life, increased productivity and cost savings. Like all new technologies, a number of challenges have arisen and must be overcome in order for the Internet of Things to achieve a stable level of use. Among the challenges faced, one of the most important is related to the security and privacy of users, such as access control. One of the most used models for access control in this universe is the model based on capabilities that use tokens to authentication and authorization of users and devices. These tokens are normally protected by encryption to provide integrity and confidentiality. However, the choice of encryption and the information contained in the tokens can drastically affect the performance of applications that require high responsiveness. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the impact that these choices generate in the final response time for the user. We defined and built an architectural prototype that made it possible to evaluate two of the main algorithms for signing tokens (HMAC and RSA). Our aim was to quantify the best trade-off in terms of safety and performance for sensitive health data generated from smart devices. The purpose is to assist application developers in the best token configuration for access control in their applications and verify which variables most impact the final response time. To achieve this goal, we adopted the Computer Systems Performance Assessment process together with a set of planning experiments that helped in the evaluation of the prototype built. In addition, we collect memory and CPU consumption metrics to assess consumption in systems with low computational power.\n",

      "Author:  Nuñez Segura, Gustavo Alonso (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Energy conservation is a main concern in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). To reduce energy consumption it is important to know how it is spent and how much is available during the node and network operation. Several previous works have proposed energy consumption models focused on the communication module, while neglecting the processing and sensing activities. Other works presented more complex and complete models, but lacked experiments to demonstrate their accuracy in real deployments. The main objective of this work is to design and to evaluate an accurate energy consumption model for WSN, which considers the sensing, processing, and communication modules usage. This model was used to implement two energy consumption prediction mechanism. One mechanism is based in Markov chains and the other one is based in time series analysis. The metrics to evaluate the model and prediction mechanisms performance were: energy consumption estimation accuracy, energy consumption prediction accuracy, and node's communication and processing resources usage. The energy consumption prediction mechanisms performance was compared using two implementation schemes: running the prediction algorithm in the sensor node and running the prediction algorithm in a Software-Defined Networking controller. The implementation was conducted using IT-SDN, a Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Network framework. For the evaluation, simulation and emulation used COOJA, while testbed experiments used TelosB devices. Results showed that considering the sensing, processing, and communication energy consumption into the model, it is possible to obtain an accurate energy consumption estimation for Wireless Sensor Networks. Also, the use of a Software-Defined Networking controller for processing complex prediction algorithms can improve the prediction accuracy.\n",

      "Abstract:  Internet was designed in a totally different context, far from what we have today. New applications, new technologies and devices define a new set of requirements, which among others, is to support mobility, security, QoS and multicast. Researchers around the world are engaged in the design of the Future Internet. While many seek to evolve the current Internet, others assume that current architecture should be ignored in order to design a new architecture. From a disruptive vision, this work aims to define, design and experimentally validate a form of referral where multicast be a central requirement for applications. This form of routing is based on new relationships between entities that communicate and use of an identification/addressing based on a topology independent name that unambiguously identifies an entity: its Title. The Entity Title Architecture (ETArch), built on an infrastructure based on software defined networking, establishes new relationships between entities in distributed systems. The definition of the Workspace, implemented in this work, allows establishing a channel through which multiple entities communicate naturally by using a multicast approach, while still allowing mobility of these entities over network. Identified by its title, the Workspace is the destination of the primitives during communication. As new entities attach or detach the Workspace is reconfigured. The approach defined, implemented and varied in this work is a more efficient way of communication compared to the addressing within the network layer (IP Multicast) or application (Application Layer Multicast). ETArch takes into account not only the aspects of multicast and mobility of the entities , but also was built with the vision to incorporate into a future time QoS and security , so it is a focal point for dialogue with other research groups to collaborate in building the next generation of computer networks.\n",

      "Abstract:  As devices in the IoT are increasing in number and capabilities, there is an opportunity of creating networks of smart devices that go beyond the current cloud-centric model of data-gathering and actuation. The Swarm project provides a middleware to create a bio-inspired distributed and organic network of heterogeneous devices. Under the context of the Swarm project, in this thesis, we aim to create a framework for the interaction of devices, consisting of registration in the network, discovery, composition, and mediation of services. Using semantics as a driving technique, we aim to create a communication framework that facilitates the development of IoT applications in the Swarm, as a first step towards constructing a smart self-organizing network for the future IoT. The proposed framework aims to overcome the problems of interoperability and composition by adapting lightweight open standards with a service-oriented architecture and novel composition and mediation mechanisms. To illustrate the use of our framework, we implemented a use case based on the recruiting of services for a surveillance system. The significant contributions of this thesis can be summarized as: an architecture and implementation for device interaction in the IoT, a lightweight model for semantic service description and semantic querying, a ranking algorithm for service selection in an economy-based IoT network, an ontology for IoT services, and a declarative composition and mediation. To evaluate our work, we used two methods. First, we performed a quantitative comparison between an implementation with and without the use of our framework, then, we conduct a qualitative comparison of features offered by our framework with other similar works.\n",

      "Abstract:  This work presents a benchmark for evaluating the performance of an embedded WandBoard Quad platform in image processing, considering the use of its GPU Vivante GC2000 in executing routines using OpenGL ES 2.0. To this goal, it has relied upon the execution of image filters in CPU and GPU. The filters are the most commonly applications used in image processing, which in turn operate through convolutions, a technique which makes use of successive matrix multiplications, which justifies a high computational cost of image filters algorithms for image processing. Thus, the use of the GPU for embedded systems is an interesting alternative that makes it feasible to image processing performing in these systems, as well as make use of a present feature in a wide range of devices on the market, it is able to accelerate image processing algorithms, which in turn are the basis for computer vision applications such as facial recognition, gesture recognition, among others. Such applications become increasingly required in a consumption and usage scenario in modern applications of embedded systems. To support this goal were carried out a comparative studies of performance between systems and between libraries capable of assisting in the use of multicore processors resources. To prove the potential of the subject matter and explain the purpose of this study, it was performed a benchmark in the form of a sequence of tests, targeting a model application that runs Sobel filter algorithm on a stream of images captured from a webcam. The application was performed directly on the embbedded CPU and GPU. As a result, running on GPU via OpenGL ES 2.0 performance achieved nearly 10 times higher with respect to the running CPU, and considering readback times, achieved total performance gain of up to 4 times.\n",

      "Abstract:  A significant number of protocols and capabilities have been proposed in recent years in response to the demand for reducing the amount of energy consumed by the network infrastructure. Besides rising economic issues, there is a widespread sensitivity to ecological impacts since both energy costs and electrical demands are in a upward trend. In this scenario, the development and validation of energy saving strategies are a key point of making networks more efficient. However, there is a lack of experimental environments designed specifically to emulate and to validate such energy efficiency solutions. This work proposes an environment not only supporting the development and discussion of energy-saving solutions but also management applications considering energy-saving primitives. For this purpose, the environment is built considering the implementation of energy efficiency capabilities that are representative of each network scope (interface, device, and network) in the Mininet environment taking as a basis the Software-defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. The environment proposed was evaluated with different experiments by comparing the energy savings obtained by activating these energy-efficiency capabilities.\n",

      "Author:  Besson, Felipe Meneses (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Web services are loosely-coupled software components designed to support interoperable machine- to-machine interaction over the Internet. To achieve such interoperability, web services are accesible through W3C web standards, independently of which language, operating system, or hardware platform they are developed. Due to these characteristics, simple web services can be combined in more complex ones. Choreographies are a distributed approach for composing web services. Compared to orchestrations, which have a centralized approach to distributed service management, the interaction among the choreographed services is collaborative with decentralized coordination. Despite the advantages, choreography development, including the testing activities, is not consolidated. The goal of this research is to develop a testing framework to support Test-Driven Development (TDD) of choreographies. Rehearsal, the proposed framework, provides features for automating the testing of (i) atomic web services (unit testing); (ii) their integration in the choreography (integration testing); and (iii) part of or the entire choreography (acceptance testing). These several levels of testing are implemented by using framework features such as the dynamic generation of web service clients, message interception, and the abstraction of the choreography into Java objects. In addition, Rehearsal supports important practices of TDD such as service mocking. To assess the developed framework, we conducted a qualitative exploratory study with Computer Science students. According to the results obtained, the features of Rehearsal were adequate for applying TDD to web service choreography development successfully.\n",

      "Author:  Ceron, João Marcelo (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Mechanisms to detect and analyze malicious software are essential to improve security systems. Current security mechanisms have limited success in detecting sophisticated malicious software. More than to evade analysis system, many malware require specific conditions to activate their actions in the target system. The flexibility of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) provides an opportunity to develop a malware analysis architecture that can detect behavioral deviations in an automated way. This thesis presents a specialized architecture to analyze malware by managing the analysis environment in a centralized way, including to control the sandbox and the elements that surrounds it. The proposed architecture enables to determine the network access policy, to handle the analysis environment resource configuration, and to manipulate the network connections performed by the malware. To evaluate our solution we have analyzed a set of malware in two evaluation scenarios. In the first evaluation scenario, we showed that the mechanisms proposed have increased the number of behavioral events in 100% of the malware analyzed. In the second evaluation scenario, we have analyzed malware designed for IoT devices. As a result, by using the MARS features, it was possible to block attacks, to manipulate attack commands, and to enable the malware communication with the respective botnet controller. The experimental results showed that our solution can improve the dynamic malware analysis process by providing this configuration flexibility to the analysis environment.\n",

      "Author:  Rodrigues, Henrique Donâncio Nunes (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  This work resides in the field of multiagent systems (MAS) composed of intelligent agents that are able to use Internet communication protocols. A multiagent platform is a software or framework capable of managing multiple aspects of the agent execution and their interactions. In the recent years, many MAS platforms have been developed, all of them compliant with interoperable system development standards at different levels. Also, new programming languages have been defined and new protocols have been adopted for communication in distributed systems. These facts also influenced the multiagent community with the proposition of new platforms to support the development of multiagent systems. In addition, the adoption of agents as a paradigm for the development of large scale complex distributed systems is seen as an interesting solution in the era of big data. Therefore, a comparison between existing platforms and their support for efficiently developing and deploying large scale multiagent systems can benefit the developer community interested in choosing which platform best fits their projects. The purpose of this work is evaluate multiagent platforms for scalability, performance and compatibility with other technologies in order to facilitate the choice of the developer that wants design large scale multiagent systems. In order to choose MAS platforms for the proposed comparison, are considered open source platforms that are actively used by the multiagent community. Moreover, these MAS platforms should be able to provide a deployment in a distributed manner, essential characteristic of scalable systems. After narrowing the list of MAS platforms according to these criteria, message transport systems are analyzed using benchmarks for scalability and performance comparison, considering different communication scenarios. Finally, a realistic scenario is presented where a scalable MAS can be adopted as a solution.\n",

      "Author:  Staschower, Enrique Grunspan (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  This dissertation deals with the urban restructuring, analyzed from the transformations that occurred in the last quarter of the twentieth century; the restructuring of the industrial model, accelerating production relations through space-time compression, thanks to communication technologies. The objective is to analyze the urban potentialities of the reintegration of the former IRF Matarazzo territory. This territory, located in São Caetano do Sul (SP), hosted a large integrated unit, symbol of an industrialization model that characterized its beginnings as vertical and centralized production; today remains disabled and ruined. At its closure, this industry demonstrated its lack of competitiveness and obsolescence, contaminating its facilities, employees and neighbors with BHC and Hg, shut down its operations in the 1980s. This territory, at the interface of the municipalities of São Caetano do Sul and São Paulo, despite of its foundational heritage, its centrality, does not realize its capital of urbanity - remains with emptiness inertia. We begin with the conceptualizations of postmodernity, followed by the conceptualization of cities, from different perspectives; to then search for theorists whom analyzed the industrial city and its models; based on these analyzes and their models, we history the evolution of cities in Brazil, the impact of industrialization and its inheritance in the metropolitan region of São Paulo; We then went into detail about the factory models that this territory hosted, from the Benedictine period until the closure of the IRF Matarazzo; from a dialectical perspective, we conceptualize space-time and industrial-urban restructuring; to analyze through those concepts other experiences of urban restructuring in the São Paulo Metropolitan area, their forms of implementation and their contribution as promoters of urbanity. We seek with this research to contribute to the understanding of industrial restructuring processes and their potential for transformation in the urban tissue, upon the challenges faced by Brazilian cities to overcome injustices and segregation, when they form enclaves that deny the concepts of city as a social element of interaction. and communication.\n",

      "Author:  Lavieri, Patrícia Sauri (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Telecommuting can be considered a measure for travel demand management since it has the potential to reduce trips by replacing a face to face activity, which requires travel, by a virtual one, with the use of information and communication technologies. The objective of this research is twofold: first, to explore and understand the adoption of telecommuting by companies in São Paulo and, second, to identify and to measure the main impacts of telecommuting on individuals activity-travel patterns. To achieve this aim, a comprehensive literature review was conducted, followed by two types of data collection efforts. First, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals responsible for Human Resources policies in ten companies adopting telecommuting or not. Second, a sample of telecommuters was recruited to answer to an online questionnaire and to provide detailed diary data for 7 days using smartphones, after which an in-depth interview was conducted. Interviews with Human Resources personnel revealed that potential benefits for companies and employees are the drivers behind the dissemination of telecommuting, although slow. As a yet unconventional practice, barriers continue to exist, particularly related to organizational culture. Data collection and analysis of telecommuters behavior shows that the congestion faced in the home-to-work trip is the main reason for adoption of telecommuting in São Paulo. Important differences in activity and travel behavior were observed between telecommuting and non-telecommuting days. While the number of participations and the time spent in non-work activities are relatively similar for the two types of days, a reduction occurred in the number of trips, total distance and time traveled on telecommuting days.\n",

      "Author:  Ishii, Renato Porfirio (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  This work presents a new scheduling policy for Network-Bound parallel applications based on impacts of the processing operations resulting from the communication among processes. The model adopted quantifies the traffic volume imposed on the communication network by means of the latency and the overhead parameters. Such parameters represent the load that each process imposes over the network and the delay on the CPU, as a consequence of the network operations. The delay is represented on the model by mean of metric measurements slowdown. The mathematics equations that quantify the costs involved in the processing operation and message exchange are defined. In the same way, equations to determine the maximum network bandwidth are used on the decision-making scheduling. Another important feature of the policy is the definition of a constant k that delimitates the communication network maximum allowed usage. The k value defines the adoption of two possible scheduling techniques: group scheduling or through communication network. The proposed techniques are incorporated to the DPWP scheduling policy (oriniginally CPU-Bound), generating an extension Network-Bound. Experimental and simulation results confirm the performance enhancement of parallel applications under supervision of the extended DPWP policy, denominated NB SP, when compared to the executions supervised by the original DPWP.\n",

      "Author:  Batista, Douglas Emiliano (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The theoretical trajectory of this thesis begins with a discussion of psychoanalytic sense about Comenius´s Magna Didactics. Through this reflection we aim to demonstrate many \"resonances\" that exist between the comenian \"teach everything to everyone\" (teaching that despite appearances is not in fact \"totalizing\", \"complete\" or \"finished\") and the \"not-all teaching\", as it is thought within Psychoanalysis and Education. And so, a not-all teaching is precisely the one that contemplates the structural gaps of knowledge (since it is necessarily endless, inconclusive, non-ending, etc.). In these terms, it is as a teacher conveys an \"endless and unfinished\" teaching or a teaching that puts in act the not-knowing that the student may find chance to bring something into question and thus, imply him or herself subjectively in what is taught (and so that it constitutes to oneself - even though in \"negative\" or latently - a singular knowledge from a transmission socially validated). In other words, on the reverse of an indispensable teaching of school knowledge, the content, the statements related to what is \"already-known\", it is crucial that both teacher and student are invoked - from different discursive positions to the level of unconscious desire that dwells in them, that is to say, that they are invoked in their own structural lack of knowledge, in their utterances, in their uniqueness, and without which the reproduction of evident knowledge no matter if it is related to the one who teaches or learns would be just a massification, a mere uniforming universalization. Then, a not-all teaching will require that the teacher does not put him or herself just as a replicator of public knowledge, since he must deposit in such teaching something unique, something of his, something from its unrepeatable enunciation. Or as in Comenius: erudition and tools already prepared do not exempt the living voice of a teacher. And it is precisely this alive voice that in principle may bring life to bookish knowledge (books are our dumb masters, said Comenius), and so that can raise a students desire to awake such public knowledge to a new life. Thus, that is how transmission is cyphered.\n",

      "Abstract:  The objective of this study is to analyze the organizational forms of citrus production in the Sao Paulo (Brazil) and Florida (USA) and the production outsourcing decisions and external investments in the Sao Paulo citriculture (i.e., its possibilities, potentials and limitations). For the theoretical and empirical analysis, models and contractual production relations in the two countries have been studied. Interviews have been made and primary sources data have been collected, obtaining qualitative data from economic agents related to public and private institutions of the Sao Paulo citrus industry, via direct research method (non simulated) through in-depth interviews. Interviews on US citriculture contract tools and recent extension services on the Florida citrus industry have also been included. A conclusion of this study is that the kinds of business of both regions have differences and similarities with respect contractual relations, strategic and organizational management, types of economic agents involved, and the peculiar characteristics of each citrus production region. Another finding of this study is that outsourcing might be one of the future ways of opening other scenarios in the organization and negotiation relations of the citriculture.\n",

      "Abstract:  Various computing systems transfer data in structured data streams which also happen to be, sometimes, hierarchically organized. Such data stream model is characterized by the dense amount of information transmitted, which requires the receiver to immediately manipulate the elements extracted from that communication channel. The high rate in which data flows also makes it hard, if not impossible, for the receiver to store the desired information in its memory, which makes data flow analysis especially challenging. This work presents a novel structured data flow analysis architecture applied to the logical hierarchy defined by the Brazilian Digital TV System for the transmission of television programs, validated by means of a fully functional reference implementation.\n",

      "Author:  Andrade, Rayssa Bruzaca de (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  In this work, we discuss a description of quantum properties of light beams produced by an Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) above threshold, pumped by a 780 nm Titanium Sapphire laser, resonant with the D2 line of Rb with a noise spectrum of a coherent beam. The twin beams have wavelengths around 1560nm, in the telecommunication band. The states emitted by the OPO under study are approximately Gaussian (1), which allows us to describe them in terms of first and second order moments. As we analyze the noise spectrum of the fluctuations of each beam, the first order moments are null, which allows us to describe the state of the system in terms of a covariance matrix. We present the behavior of the noise spectrum and the correlations between the reflected pump, signal and idler beams. In addition, we applied different entanglement criteria to study the system. We present a prediction of the bipartite entanglement using Duan criterion (2). For tripartite correlations, we use the Furusawa criterion (3). We performed a study of bipartition pump and sum quadrature. As well, we applied the PPT criterion (4) for continuous variables, independently transposing each beam under study. The PPT criterion is necessary and sufficient to demonstrate entanglement between bipartitions for Gaussian states. In order to explore the behavior of the system using the steering criterion in the model developed by Reid (5), we theoretically study the criterion of inference for bipartite quadratures: between the twin beams or between one of the twin beams and the pump beam. In addition, we analyzed the inference between the three modes, through the bipartition pump mode and combination of sum quadrature of the twin beams. We develop a quantum teleportation protocol of a coherent input state, composed by the Titanium Sapphire beam whose Bell measurement is performed using the pump reflected by the OPO as an entangled state for the signal and idler beams as a first possibility to implement the protocol. Furthermore, we propose a protocol in which the signal beam assists in the process of teleportation. Thus, the fidelity of the system increases and exceeds the limit of non-cloning. We will describe the first measurements of correlations between the beams emitted by the OPO for this system. The tripartite entanglement characterization is the first step in the implementation of quantum optical protocols using a source of entangled states that is compatible with both Rubidium atomic systems and the telecommunications region, thus forming a quantum network.\n",

      "Abstract:  I carried out the reading of an educational praxis in the context of health, by recuperating part of my working trajectory. This proposition held as its main focus the communicative concern, for considering that the presence of this dimension in the educational act has not always aroused the necessary attention on the part of the health educator. In this work I emphasized the dialogical conception of communication. The object of this thesis consists of a series of relationships between communicational and pedagogical practices in the area of health. Interlocutors were invited and the educational premises, the communicational practices and the health conceptions were analysed. Based on the dialogues between the interlocutors and other texts it was possible to verify the need of reflecting upon the phenomenon of education in the area of health by replacing the several types of knowledge that are part of the practices and reflections involved in this praxis. The idea that was defended in this work is that the relations between education and communication in the area of health, are not given a priori. The reading allowed for the location of the educational praxis in question under a dialogical perspective and it also pointed out for the need of rethinking the demands of being an educator. The contribution of this study is of creating a motto for the continuity of the interlocution.\n",

      "Abstract:  Mobile telephony systems have been constantly asked for new demands of value added services. Voice traffic only is not enough anymore to support the new needs of mobile users because nowadays they ask for fast, cost-efficient, cheap and mobile services to support electronic mail, videoconference or Internet access. This work presents a method of how to determine minimum rates on traffic channels to support these services. Considering CDMA2000 technology, an impact analysis will be made in the air interface for these specific traffic channels. Same analysis will be made when minimum or maximum rates are reserved for each user, also comparing the time needed for data transmission, efficiency of the cell (useful rate / maximum rate) and others. The conclusions of this work may allow strategies to support data users in mobile telephony networks in such different ways, as better cost-effective solution, specific segment of the market (i.e., to concentrate in services with higher or lower transmission rates) or even to foresee the amount of resources needed in a network to support a forecasted number of users.\n",

      "Abstract:  This thesis presents an analysis of Path Computation Element Architecture (PCE) as an alternative to be implemented in heterogeneous network inter-domain routing, in other words, environments where optical domains are integrated with the electronic domains of conventional networks. Also, the ability of PCE to manage issues regarding the transmission quality of the optical signal, the QoT (Quality of Transmission), is presented. Objectives and functionality of the PCE mechanism in integrated networks is detailed. Concepts and definitions regarding optical networks and their main elements, the aim of interconnection with conventional networks to build a unified and integrated network, the role of control planes, and the main routing mechanisms are also presented. The analysis of the PCE was focused on the behavior of its main protocol, called PCE Protocol. Specifically, the analysis was performed on both its request and response messages, in addition, the interference in the traffic of the links where these messages had been introduced was also analyzed. Afterwards, an extension of the PCE Protocol parameters was proposed based on the study of optical transmission characteristics, with the aim of meeting specific QoT requirements. From these definitions, further analyses of the impact on the traffic in links with different bandwidths were performed, using the PCE protocol, with and without the proposed extension, allowing a comparison between them.\n",

      "Abstract:  We live now in an convergence of technologies era, driven by economic and operational issues, where the data services, voice and video are quickly moving to an IP platform. Particularly considering the paradigm of IP telephony in the process of convergence, there are technological challenges. We have subscribers who already have a reference about the quality of speech, derived from decades of using the traditional phone system. At the other end telecom operators that rely on statistical networks, with no possibility to guarantee QoS. So it becomes vital to the operations success the proper identification of the relationships between the various components between the terminals and their contribution to the speech quality perceived by the subscriber in order to deliver a quality service close to the PSTN. In this context, this study sought to identify a correlation between objective metrics for Quality of Service applicable to IP networks and subjective quality of speech predicted by the algorithm \"Model-E\" defined in ITU-T G.107 through multivariate statistical techniques. A method of collecting and analyzing statistical information was developed to achieve the proposed objective. To validate a test environment was created, operation data were collected and computational tools were applied to the analytical and statistical treatment. The results obtained by the method were then applied in the field during the stages of testing and approval of an IMS-IP-PBX designed for the corporate market. The correlation between the various factors involved, their metrics and how the whole system impacts on the quality perceived by end users will enable service providers to assess what the best strategies to use in their network segments to ensure an adequate level of service offered to consumers.\n",

      "Abstract:  On what is written of a psychoanalysis deals with, as the title itself hints, the (im)possibilities of transmitting what in a psychoanalytic experience, is in itself written. Is there a way of writing that allows to share the knowledge that is acquired during the process? To foreground and highlight the form, the mode of presenting that process was the starting point of this essay. After all, the means of transmission are included in what is being transmitted (up to a point where the form is the message). To write about writing, sometimes, is nothing but writing. Other than giving an account of the discontinuous experience of a psychoanalysis, this paper aims to demonstrate the written-effect (the written outcome) of my own analysis. A linear account of what happened there, illustrated by dialogs and anecdotes, would not sustain any real transmission of the effect a psychoanalysis has on anybody. Our goal is sharing with the reader the new knowledge that resulted from a singular working through, which due to its own peculiar construction demands, exacts from us many different formats. It is a work that results in a presentation that goes much further than a simple report.

      "Author:  Torre Neto, André (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  This work describes the development of an automatic data acquisition system for environmental variables that includes the transmission of the acquired data in real time or later time to the computational facilities of a laboratory. These data are to be supplied for a modeling of pesticide transport in soil program that is executed in a RISC/UNIX workstation. The system was devised and implemented considering multipoint serial bus architecture and reads up to 240 sensors. The data transmission is performed through a two-link telemetry chain, radio (3 km) and telephone line (130 km). A personal computer named Remote Storage Unit (RSU) was used to join these links. The data acquisition is supervised by the RSU. In order to execute this task a graphics user interface based program (Windows) was created. The program presupposes the distribution of the soil sensors in up to four plots. This program performs the functions of: a) controlling the data acquisition system such as sample intervals and sensors range; b) verifying the consistency of data; c) allowing the complementation of data with manual entries related to artificial rains and pesticide applications; d) locally storing the data in mass memory; e) sending these data to the laboratories, when requested; f) real time monitoring of readings; and g) indicating any system failure. Besides the data transmission the telephone line link can also be used to operate the RSU remotely. The system is operating in the field (Estação Experimental de Pindorama, IAC) for more than two years. Climatologically variables, soil temperature and soil matric potential are being measured at 10 minutes sample interval. During this test period the system operation was interrupted several times due to secondary effects of lightning. Despite of the usual taken cares as line-protection circuits, adequate system grounding and the installation of lightning rods these efforts were not efficient and must be improved\n",

      "Author:  Lipas Augusto, Marcelo (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The use of network trac models that hold self-similar and long-range dependence characteristics have shown to be a key element on the correct characterization of Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) network trac [1, 2]. Such characterization is necessary to monitor and control the network trac in converged networks [3]. In this context, the accurate estimation of the selfsimilarity parameter, named Hurst parameter, is a major issue. However, studies show that, besides the long-range dependence, WAN network trac may, not uncommonly, present mixed long and short-range dependence characteristics [4, 5]. While great part of either theoretical or practical scientic literature has been focused on the issue of Hurst parameter estimator accuracy [6, 7, 8, 9], little attention has been given to the estimation of such parameter in the presence of short-range dependence. This research work has focused on the study of the Hurst parameter estimation methods based on the wavelet spectrum, specially through the Abry-Veitch method [10] { which is based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) transform { and through the wavelet spectrum based on the Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT) transform. The results based on the Abry-Veitch method show that, through a suitable adjustment of the estimation parameters, such method yields a robust estimation in the presence of short-range dependence components, even in changing conditions of such component, a desirable characteristic for the real-time estimation of the Hurst parameter. However, the signi cant dispersion presented, occasionally, by the Abry-Veitch method estimates motivated the research of the usage of the wavelet spectrum obtained via DWPT transform to estimate the Hurst parameter. The results show that the usage of such transform generates such a wavelet spectrum that it is possible to detect whether short-range dependence components are present, or not, in the analyzed series. At the end, the research results are summarized and used to propose a realtime Hurst parameter estimation mechanism, in the presence of simultaneous long- and short-range dependence components.\n",

      "Author:  Guirelli, Cleber Roberto (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Nowadays, with privatization of utility companies and increase in competition in the energy market, companies must increase their service quality and ensure profits. Short term load forecasting is essential for operation of power systems and can increases security and reduces generation costs. Forecasting the load demands the identification of load patterns and its relations with exogenous variables such as weather. Originally, the problem was solved using mathematics and statistics with techniques such as time series, which produces good results but are complex and have a difficult modeling. With the advent of artificial intelligence techniques, new tools capable of dealing with large amounts of data and learn by themselves system variables relations were available. Artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic came up as the most suitable for load forecasting that have been tested and used for load forecasting for the last 20 years. This work presents a methodology for daily load forecasting of electrical areas using artificial intelligence techniques, specifically neural networks. At first, forecasting techniques are presented with emphasis on neural networks and fuzzy logic. Acquisition and treatment of data are analyzed. The load forecasting using neural networks and fuzzy logic is described and the results of the development and tests of a load forecasting system at CTEEP Transmissão Paulista presented. As contribution of this thesis, Wavelet transform is analyzed as a tool for denoising and data compression for neural network load forecasting.\n",

      "Author:  Gallo, Diego Sanchez (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Citizen sensing is a new sensor-based data collection paradigm and is focused on the extraction of data generated by people. Initiatives based on this concept are becoming crucial for designers of intelligent urban infrastructures, since they enable the collection of several types of relevant data that cannot be properly captured by traditional physical sensors. A large number of articles and projects associated to the topic appeared over the last few years, and with them the need for properly classify and organize these works. In the current work, we propose a taxonomy of citizen sensing initiatives and illustrate each of its dimensions through a survey of recent articles in the area. The proposed scheme also supports the identification and stimulates the development of projects addressing data collection methodologies that have not been properly explored so far. Focusing on active citizen sensing through mobile applications, we present a specification language designed to allow the description of such applications, and a platform implemented to interpret specifications described using this language and instantiate both the mobile app for data collection as well as the backend server to receive, validate and visualize the data, facilitating the conception and 'implementation' of new apps even by people without any knowledge about software development. We also report a real-world experiment in which we used our platform to map accessibility conditions of streets and sidewalks located in a four square kilometers area in São Paulo, Brazil, showing that a full coverage was obtained with the support of eight volunteers after only three hours. Such experiment illustrates the effectiveness of the technology, since the city of São Paulo, with an area of approximately fifteen hundred square kilometers, could be mapped by only three thousand people over the same three hours interval. Concluding this work, a generalization of the solution is discussed, demonstrating the applicability of the same platform in scenarios other than smart cities, such as participatory sensing for risk of work accidents in manufacturing compa nies, and others. Finally, we present some directions for future work at the development of Decision Support Systems based on information from citizen sensing, and the usage of Big Data technologies for capturing, aggregating, analyzing, and extracting knowledge from data generated by the different types of citizen sensing techniques presented in the taxonomy, including data from social networks, physical sensors, and image processing.\n",

      "Author:  Muñoz, Mauro Enrique de Souza (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  In artificial intelligence some cognitive agent models based on Jean Piaget's intelligence development theory have been proposed. Although the proposed models implement some fundamental aspects of this theory, like the cognitive schema struture, they do not consider the symbol grounding problem. Therefore, they are not concerned about the theoretical aspects that lead to the autonomous aquisition of the basic semantics needed by the cognitive organization of the agent's external world, as for the object concept aquisition. A computational cognitive scheme model inspired on Piaget's theory of the sensorimotor intelligence is presented. The scheme is autonomously built by computational mechanisms using principles considering the symbol grounding problem. The proposed scheme model uses sensory-motor situations to perceive, capture and store the finest grain deterministic causal relations. These causal relations are then expanded in time and space by more complex computational structures using the first ones. Those complex structures itselves are also designed in a way they can be used by more complex structures, expanding even further the causal relations in time and space. The proposed scheme model is implemented by an artificial neural network using feedforward architecture. The neural network output layer units progressively organized to compose a sensory-motor graph. Some known computational mechanisms from artificial inteligence were modified to fit to the zero semantic and the autonomous mental development paradigms, conceived in this work as the premises to handle the symbol grounding problem. The scheme model inspired by Piaget's theory implemented by the proposed self organizing sensorimotor graph in conjunction with the computational principles used, goes toward to the artificial autonomous cognitive development of the object concept.\n",

      "Author:  Nardin, Luis Gustavo (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  In Multiagent Systems (MAS), controlling the internal agent's behavior is impossible and therefore social dilemma may emerge. One possible approach to solve the problem is the social approach, which considers reputation as its main control mechanism. In order to accelerate the reputation evaluation, it is essential that the cooperating agents could exchange information about reputation. Thus, by using observations, evaluations and information exchange about reputation the social order in the global system may occur. However, the semantic heterogeneity of different reputation models makes agent interaction a problem, especially in open MAS. This work proposes a service oriented architecture, named SOARI, to deal with this problem. This architecture supports concept mapping and translation among different reputation model ontologies by using a common ontology. In order to illustrate its deployment, several experiments in the electronic commerce and art appraisal domains were performed. In the latter it was analyzed the effects caused on the agents as a consequence of a more expressive and heterogeneous communication about reputation.\n",

      "Author:  Mattiuzzo, Marcela (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The objective of this work is to provide some clarity on what the role of the Law can be in shedding light upon algorithmic discrimination, as well as how legal instruments could help minimize its risks, with a specific focus on the Brazilian jurisdiction. To do so, it first engages in a debate about what algorithms indeed are, and how the emergence of the data-driven economy, Big Data, and machine learning have leveraged the use of automated systems. Next, it conceptualizes discrimination, and suggesting a typology of algorithmic discrimination that takes statistics into account to provide a rationalization of the debate. It moves on to discussing the path towards enforcing legal norms against discriminatory outcomes running from the use of algorithms. Because legislation specifically aimed at fighting automated systems is still scarce (or application of the current legislation to the problem is contentious), it engages in a debate about the horizontal effects of fundamental rights - given that a relevant part of discriminatory practices occur among private parties, and the most basic defense an individual has against discrimination is the constitutional right to equality. It then analyzes ordinary legislation in three jurisdictions, the United States of America, Germany, and Brazil, that could also be enforced against discriminatory practices running from algorithms, with a special focus on the Brazilian legislation. The legislative debate concludes with the presentation of two concrete cases of algorithmic discrimination, one concerning the unemployment policy in Poland, and the other regarding credit scoring in Brazil. The cases are presented so that the applicability of Brazilian legislation to deal with algorithmic discrimination can be discussed. The final chapter is focused on debating the path forward and what can and should be done by experts, legislators, and policymakers to foster algorithmic innovation without losing sight of its potential for discrimination. It first presents the literature on algorithmic governance and the many proposals for dealing with the problem - dedicating a specific section to the challenges brought about by machine learning - and then sets out an agenda for Brazil.\n",

      "Author:  Saraiva, Filipe de Oliveira (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The smart grids represent a new generation of electric power systems, combining advances in computing, communication, distributed systems, and artificial intelligence, to provide new features to the power systems as the real-time demand monitoring and real-time energy consumption monitoring, large-scale managing of distributed generators, among others. It is possible by the existence of a distributed control system on the grid. This structure modifies the way it conducts the planning and operation of electrical systems currently, especially in the distribution level, and there are interesting possibilities for research and development made possible by the need for implementation of these features. With this scenario in mind, this thesis uses an approach based on multi-agent systems to simulate this new power distribution system, considering different control options. The use of multi-agent systems technology for smart grid simulation is based on the concept of smart grid as a distributed system - this conceptualization is realized in this work too. In order to validate this proposal, three features expected of these grids were simulated: the classification of non-linear loads; the voltage profile management; and the topological reconfiguration in order to reduce electrical losses. All modeling and developments of these studies are reported here. Finally, the study aims to identify the multi-agent systems as a technology to be utilized both for research and for implementing these grids.\n",

      "Author:  Barros, Joy Nunes da Silva (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  This study specifically aims to analyze the current efforts for the legitimization of elearning. Given the expansion of online learning programs in our country, this phenomenon is often characterized as a process of democratization of education. However, the imputation of the adjective \"democratizing\" involves not only an indication of the increased access provided by this means of learning, but also assigns it a moral quality. In other words, the proposition that states the increase in vacancies promoted by this learning method was established as a process of democratization is not restricted to the expression of a factual judgment, but is presented as a positive moral judgment, since \"being democratic\" is constituted as a value in our present time. Thus, in addition to adjudicating whether or not this process is a type of democratization - since that would require some previous conception of democracy that would enable such adjudication - this study investigates which elements support this proposition. For this purpose, we investigated what can be understood as democratizing in two senses: quantitatively and qualitatively. With regard to the latter, we considered the historical and social context from which e-learning has been considered in Brazilian official documents as \"a new educational paradigm\". Today, such context is generally known as \"Knowledge Society\" - a conceptual construct that increasingly expands and creates standards to educational processes whereas the \"learning for life\" concept is converted into the imperative of an age where knowledge is regarded as the major productive force. However, in turn, the so-called Knowledge Society, which has as its most concrete manifestation the e-learning, presents itself as the promise of a better world in the future, where instructed and creative men will be able to live democratically in the technological agora , raised from the development of new telematics technologies. Thus, the Knowledge Society presents itself as the new utopia of our times. Based on the analysis of the claim that the phenomenon of e-learning is a form of democratization, this study investigates the relationship between education, democracy and technology at the present time.\n",

      "Author:  Onoe, Alberto Yoshinobu (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  SOA Service Oriented Architecture has been established as the paradigm for IT Information Technology systems development, due to its features that promotes flexibility, agility, reuse and scalability. However, an SOA application to be successful must be supported by effective governance. How to develop and maintain this governance up to date in a fast and unpredictable environment is a great challenge. This work aims to present a methodology that allows a modest IT infrastructure to be able to cope with SOA governance, using dynamic capabilities (particular abilities and routines of an organization). The contribution of this work is the link (practically inexistent) between lines of research in SOA governance and dynamic capabilities. To accomplish this purpose, this work sought to what must be done (framework), who is the responsible for the development and maintenance (owner), and how to perform the SOA governance (platform). The development has been founded by an extensive research of involved concepts, inference of required dynamic capabilities to maintain the SOA governance and the development of a platform that allows a process analyst to change SOA governance interactively. The results were a methodology and a maintenance system of SOA operational governance. The methodology comprises the requirements and changes in the analysis procedure of the elements of the SOA governance. The system is composed of an agile and effective implementation framework and platform that enable how to apply dynamic capabilities into the SOA governance. The Introduction presents examples of practical application (motivation), the goal, the justification, and the scope. Chapter 2 presents an extensive literature review about SOA, SOA governance, and dynamic capabilities, from both academic and commercial literature. Chapter 3 presents the methodology and a brief history of the development. Chapter 4 presents the development of the proposed system. Chapter 5 discusses some topics related to the proposition. Chapter 6 presents the conclusion and proposals for future developments.\n",

      "Abstract:  This work applies complex network theory to the problem of semi-supervised and unsupervised learning in networks that are representations of multivariate datasets. Complex networks allow the use of nonlinear dynamical systems to represent behaviors according to the connectivity patterns of networks. Inspired by behavior observed in nature, such as competition for limited resources, dynamical system models can be employed to uncover the organizational structure of a network. In this dissertation, we develop a technique for classifying data represented as interaction networks. As part of the technique, we model a dynamical system inspired by the biological dynamics of resource competition. So far, similar methods have focused on vertices as the resource of competition. We introduce edges as the resource of competition. In doing so, the connectivity pattern of a network might be used not only in the dynamical system simulation but in the learning task as well.\n",

      "Abstract:  The present thesis develops a research concerned with the position of psychoanalysis within the boundaries of the philosophical and political thought of Cornelius Castoriadis (1922-1975), conferring a particular emphasis on the second stage of his work initiated in 1968. The framework investigates and discusses especially two hypotheses: 1. The paradigmatic function of psychoanalysis (theory and practice) with has been constitutive viewing the formulation of the subject conception and therefore comprises the statement of autonomy -- concept that progressively acquired a central role in the castoridian body of work. 2. The model of subject - that arises stemmed by this reflection results sui generis, for it distinct from the prevailing philosophies of the second half of the twentieth century and represents a conceptual turning point that conducts to consider and regard the future of philosophy. Throughout the text there is also the inspection of the articulation process between psychoanalysis and Castoriadis mother ideas, namely: radical imagination, creation, social imaginary significations, social imaginary institutor, etc. As for conclusion, the text attempts to clarify some consequences derived from this turning point considering the context of political, sociohistorical institutional and even psychic scopes.\n",

      "Abstract:  In this work we have developed a prototype to analyze fluorescence microscopy images obtained from the FTA-ABS. This test is used as confirmation of the diagnosis of syphilis by identifying the bacteria causing the disease. A considerable problem in the analysis of such images is the subjectivity in the interpretation of fluorescence intensity shown, because there is not a formal description of this value, another difficulty is the low contrast between the object of study and the background and finally the distribution of fluorescence on bacteria is not uniform. The proposed methodology for the diagnosis by means of image analysis consists of three stages. The first step is to image processing. For such algorithms are used to increase the contrast between the background image and the object under study. It follows the completion of the segmentation of the image, using algorithms for binarization and region growing. The second step is performed for the classification of pixels into color groups predefined by using Artificial Neural Networks trained with the Backpropagation algorithm. At this stage several neural networks are trained and tested to classify pixels into five classes of different colors. The interpretation of these colors in the third step is accomplished through the use of fuzzy techniques.\n",

      "Author:  Oliveira Filho, Evaldo Araújo de (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  In a general sense, any system which incorporates knowledge from sample data can be called a learning machine (natural or artificial). Given a set D of samples which carries information about a rule, there are different measures of how much a system has learnt about the rule and therefore comprises a good representation of its. We are not only interested in learning that can reproduce D, but also generate new consistent data. Therefore, once fixed a system (a machine or an algorithm), to learn means to find a state of the system that generalizes the source rule of D. We looked at Bayesian formulations of the learning problem, which is a formalism identical to Statistical Mechanics. Relevant knowledge about a given system is encoded in a partition function Z. Then, any inference can be made by treating Z, and if we know Z we know the system's properties. The function Z is the posterior distribution P(|D) in the Bayesian approach, calculated by the Bayes' rule P(A, B) = P(A/B)P(B). Although the Bayesian theory is naturally paralleled in equilibrium Statistical Mechanics, it holds the promise of leading to results in problems that can be classified as non-equilibrium. One of this problems that has been the subject of increasing attention is that of learning non-stationary concepts The aim of this thesis was to study Bayesian learning when in addition to the knowledge to the data set D we have the information that the rule which gave rise to the samples is non-stationary, thereby introducing time into what would otherwise, have been an equilibrium problem. ln particular we studied learning of several forms of time dependent concepts by neural networks (more specifically, perceptrons), for which there is no need to change the likelihood. We concentrated on changing the prior knowledge in a way that reflects the aging possibility of the data on an unknown time scale. By introducing a prior probability distribution for the time scale, we found a effective posterior distribution with an algebraic decaying tail, which resulted in a new algorithm that was able to adapt satisfactory. We also applied the new algorithm to the learning with noise data and discussed some new possibilities about algorithms for perceptrons.\n",

      "Author:  Cadurin, Leonardo Dal Picolo (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The objective of this study was to analyze the potential demand for a pedelec sharing system at the São Carlos campus of the University of São Paulo (USP), aiming at the displacements of students between the two campus Areas. The set of procedures developed to reach the objective has involved two steps: characterization of the target audience and analysis of the potential demand for shared pedelecs. The first step was accomplished with a questionnaire designed with a stated preference approach for identifying users' preferences regarding shared pedelecs and the bus system operated by the university. The survey results, which involved variables of weather conditions, existence of bike paths/bike lanes between the campus Areas, and occupancy rates at the USP bus stop, were subsequently used to calibrate a logit model and to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The survey data were also used in the second step of the process, in which an electronic spreadsheet was created to analyze the probabilities of choosing the pedelec alternative (instead of the bus route operated by university). The spreadsheet was also fed with meteorological data of São Carlos in the period between 2011 and 2015. Some of the obtained outcomes are highlighted in the sequence. The probability of a pedelec being chosen is almost three times higher if bike paths/bike lanes do exist than if they do not exist. The occupancy rates of the bus stop are also particularly relevant. The probability of someone choosing a pedelec nearly doubles when the bus stop is crowded. Regarding the weather conditions, the highest probabilities are observed in the Fall and Winter seasons, i. e. in the driest and coldest days. For the entire academic period comprised between 2011 and 2015, the probabilities range from 9% (empty bus stop) to 19% (full bus stop), considering the current situation (i. e. no cycleways connect the two campus Areas). In the presence of this cycling infrastructure, however, the probability goes up to 54%. Thus, the strategy of analysis conceptually developed, and made available through an electronic spreadsheet, may be an important support tool for the implementation of transport policies by the campus administration. In addition, it highlights a likely potential demand for a system of shared pedelecs.\n",

      "Author:  Valdivia, Fernando Geronimo Ancco (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Animal behavior associated with morphological characteristics supplies evidence for a better understanding of how sexual behavior has evolved, and how organisms can maximize their reproductive success. Factors such as size, fat reserves and other sexual characters such as coloration are essential to individual better performance in relation to conspecifics. These factors? Can bring information of the male quality to other conspecifics and females. This quality keeps relation with the physical condition (energy reserves) that they have which is required to succeed in breeding, as reproduction is one of the most expensive activity in energy cost in relation to other activities. The reproductive behavior is related to the individual fat reserves that influences, among other factors, in the condition that they adopt and to the duration in time of the related interactions to reproduction. Therefore, individuals with more developed characteristics or with better physical conditions will have an advantage in the reproduction comparing with other individuals of the community. The dragonfly Zenithoptera lanei is a Neotropical species present in Brazil, only studied so far by Guillermo-Ferreira in 2015, when structures that conform this pruinosity and his function in the intraspecific communication were described. In this study, describe the sexual behavior of Z. lanei (Libellulidae). Was hypothesized that in this species males present territorial behavior, and that the coloration of wings, body size and the energy reserves (fat) may play an important role in territorial condition and reproductive success. Thus, males with higher quantity of energy and larger size should win more disputes, defend territories and, therefore, maintain the territorial condition. In addition, was also assessed whether this condition of territoriality may influence the duration of the copulation and oviposition by females. The results showed that males are territorial, and its territoriality keeps relation with size and the physical condition. In other words, males with larger body and higher energy reserves have won more disputes and maintained a territory. Although males were territorial, there was no difference between the duration of reproductive interactions, winning males and losers, thus indicating that the reproductive interactions are not influenced by the condition of territoriality of the male.\n",

We have selected four juvenile series to explore their potential in teaching, they are: Lucky Starr by Isaac Asimov, Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer, How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell and Percy Jackson & the Olympians by Rick Riordan. These series have the plot based on fantasy resources. The generative trajectory of the greimasian semiotics helped us as an analytical reference in the verification of how science is represented in fantasy books. Overall, we have seen that science is implicitly present in series, through technology and imaginary beings such as fairies, gods and dragons. Because it is more recent and known among the public, we have selected the book The Lightning Thief, the first book of Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, for development activities and application. The activities were implemented in a public school of São Paulo-SP, in a book club project called LUCIA (Portuguese acronym for Universal Readings and Investigative Science for Teenagers), organized by the research group in which this work is part. The target audience consisted of students from the 8th and 9th grade of elementary school, with participation of school teachers and undergraduates of the EACH-USP, who acted as monitors. We applied two activities with an hour and a half each, and our goals were to assess whether the students would realize how science would be represented in the book The Lightning Thief, by reading the book excerpts, discussion, preparation of drawings and questionnaires, to indicate the students' understanding of the relationship between science and Greek mythology in this book. As a result, it seems that the chosen literary work was feasible to discuss scientific issues implicit in the story. Moreover, we believe that juvenile literature, specifically the books that are read and admired by students, can be used in the classroom, allowing science to be disseminated, exploited and questioned through fantasy.\n",

      "Title:  Differences in problem-solving and behavioral innovation in Tropidurus torquatus (Squamata: Tropiduridae) lizards resident from different types of territories\n",
      "Author:  Rodrigues, André Vieira (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Behavioral flexibility is the ability of behavioral adjustments that allow individuals to respond to a new environmental challenge by either modifying their responses or developing new strategies when facing novel stimuli. This new behavior may be target of natural selection, despite not being heritable. What is transferred to the next generation is the capacity to adjust behavior. Thus, it is plausible to assume the existence of an association between cognitive capabilities and environmental severity. In this context, it is expected that territorial individuals exhibit cognitive capabilities associated with their specific habitat. Studies have often been focused on differences of problem-solving capabilities in animals from different species and populations. Nevertheless, the present study compares problem-solving abilities of Tropidurus torquatus lizards from the same population that use two types of territories that differ in the level of harshness: house walls, a harsh environment, and trees, a mild environment. This species exhibits a territorial system where dominant males and associated females have an evident fidelity to their territories. Lizards were observed in the field for territory characterization and then performed problem-solving tests in the laboratory. The results show that lizards from harsh environments outperformed those from mild environments in the problem-solving tasks and were more likely to show a behavioral innovation when solving the task. Interpretations for these results resides on two possible explanations. Lizards from walls might benefit from enhanced cognitive capabilities because natural selection acted on behavioral flexibility and selected individuals that can deal with problems of a harsh environment. Alternatively, it is possible that the majority of Tropidurus torquatus lizards exhibit enhanced problem-solving capability, but this characteristic might be cryptic, and only the interaction between the individual and living in a harsh environment (walls) induces the emergence of enhanced cognitive capabilities. These findings probably indicate that differences in problem-solving and cognitive capabilities might be exposed to specific selective regimes even before population segregation occurs.\n",

      "Abstract:  The fine needle biopsy is an important procedure to investigations in tumors, low-cost considered, minimally invasive and ideal for supplying an accurate diagnosis in cases of thyroid gland nodules. The exactness is essential for the successful accomplishment of the needle biopsy and the practice provides significant benefits in the recovery of the patient, as well as in attainment of accurate results. This thesis investigated the possibility of the development of virtual reality simulator for the training of the ultrasound guided needle biopsy of thyroid gland nodules. The proposed and developed virtual reality simulator is also an educative tool, because besides practicing the procedure, the user can visualize thyroid model to feel its texture, as well as a complete model of the neck with all its internal organs and it can be rotated. The system consists of two interfaces: first is a three-dimensional which presents the virtual models with stereoscopy in the visualization table, whose interaction of the user is made through the keyboard or haptic device (Phantom OmniTM); and second one that simulates the ultrasound images, with all the functionalities of a real examination, manipulated by the mouse. The two interfaces communicate with each other and all the process is shown in the instructor window that substitutes the supervisor and guides the user during the training. The virtual reality simulator was experimentally evaluated by professionals of the medical and technological areas, being approved as a tool for training and education in needle biopsy of the thyroid gland nodules.\n",

      "Author:  Piazentin, Denis Renato de Moraes (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  This dissertation aims to examine the K-sets, a hierarchy of biologically plausible neural networks, and apply them to the problem of motor imagery classification through electroencephalogram (EEG). Motor imagery is the act of processing a motor movement from long-term to short-term memory. Motor imagery leaves a trail in the EEG signal, which makes possible the identification and classification of different motor movements. Motor imagery classification is a complex problem due to non-linearity of the EEG time series, low signal-to-noise ratio, and the small amount of data typically available for learning. K-sets are a connectionist model that simulates the dynamic and chaotic behavior of populations of neurons in the brain, modeled based on observations of the olfactory system by Walter Freeman. K-sets have already been used in several different classification domains, including EEG, showing good results. Due to the characteristics of motor imagery classification, a hypothesis that the application of K-sets in the task could provide good results was raised. A simulator for K-sets was created for the experiments. Unfortunately, the hypothesis could not be validated, as the results of the conducted experiments with K-sets and motor imagery showed no significant improvements in comparison in the task performed.\n",

      "Author:  Santos, Walmir Romário dos (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The aim of this research was to analyze the sources of professional knowledge of handball coaches. The present study was based on the Learning Situations theory (WERTHNER; TRUDEL, 2006), has a qualitative approach and is characterized as a descriptive and exploratory research. Two complementary studies (theoretical and empirical) were part of this dissertation. Study I is a literature review on the sources of learning of sports coaches, where it was possible to verify through 33 scientific articles which are the sources of knowledge and how this process of professional development of coaches occurs. Study II started from a cross-sectional approach, through semi-structured interviews with 19 handball coaches from two of the largest leagues in the State of São Paulo (13 men and 6 women - with a minimum experience of 1 year and a maximum of 24 years). The research instrument used was developed by the researcher responsible for the study. The objective of these interviews was to understand and discuss the sources of knowledge of these professionals and the academic disciplines considered to be the most relevant. The classification of learning was organized according to the theory of learning situations (mediated, direct and internal). The collected information was analyzed through thematic analysis after categorizing the data using the Nvivo software. The results showed seven themes: \"role of higher education\", \"courses outside the university context\", \"previous experiences\", \"specific materials for improvement\", \"games and training\", \"attitudes and decisions of the coach\" and \"reflections\". It was identified that among the situations of mediated, direct and internal learning, most of the identified contents are direct situations. The mediated situations received criticism from the professionals, mainly for being out of context of the professional practices of the coaches. On the other hand, internal situations were present in all speeches, being crucial for the profession. Therefore, based on the information obtained in the two studies that guided this research, it is suggested that the current education system needs further reflection, mainly about a theoretical-practical approach. In this context, future investigations must be carried out in order to investigate other teaching strategies for the professional development of sports coaches.\n",

      "Abstract:  Reptiles represent a unique group for the study of sexual development, since they present different mechanisms of sex determination, from the determination of the ge-netic sex to the determination of sex by temperature. In the vast majority of sex deter-mination and development studies in reptiles, oviparous species have been used. Thus, new studies need to include viviparous species, such as rattlesnake and jararaca, which make it possible to monitor the fetal-to-fetal relationship and the total develop-ment of the embryo and the fetus. Thus, the development of gonads and copulatory organs would be one of the criteria for sexual evaluation of the embryonic and fetal phases of snakes. This work aims to follow the maternal-fetal relationship and the de-velopment of gonads and copulatory organs in Crotalus durissus and Bothrops ja-raraca. The fetuses of C.durissus and B. jararaca were arranged in the dorsum-medial plane of pregnant females, which may favor the protection and development of em-bryos / fetuses. Fetuses of both sexes presented the sexual differentiation of the gonads and development of the remainder of the reproductive tract from stage 35 exhibit the genital papillae from stage 35. In the male fetuses, the seminiferous tubules formed in the fetal phase, but females did not observe the presence of follicles at this stage. Disorders in sexual differentiation may produce intersex fetuses such as the B. jararaca fetus observed by us.\n",

      "Author:  Cavlac, Carolina Limonge (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Morphological descriptions are the first steps to understand the physiology of organisms and their systems. Developmental biology and ontogeny of hematopoiesis of snakes are poorly known, and the embryonic hematopoiesis is completely unknown. The main goals of this study were to characterize the embryonic and hematopoiesis development of the false coral snake Oxyrhopus guibei (Dipsadidae: Xenodontinae) since oviposition. Analysis of external morphological characters regarding the classification developmental stages for developmental stages classification has been made for 30 embryos with 1 -3, 15, 25, 30, 45, 65 and ~ 75 days after oviposition days (o.d.) (when hatched), and histological sections of 29 eggs (or embryos) from 1-3, 15, 25, 30, 45, 60o.d. and one day neonates and one week after birth for the characterization of embryonic hematopoiesis. The embryos with 1-3o.d. were ranked between 17 and 23 stages (st.), with the absence of eye formation to the presence of unpigmented eyes; with 15o.d. in 26 st., with pigmented eyes and calcified endolymphatic duct; with 25o.d. in 31 st., with unpigmented body scales and muscles of the flanks not fused in the midline, with 30o.d. between 31 and 33 st., which in addition to the preceeding form, have full eyelid membrane and muscles fused at midline in the pre-cardiac region; with 45d.o. between 34 and 36 st., with muscles completely fused in the midline and beginning the development of pigmentation pattern, with 65o.d. in 37 st. (last stage of table) with the distinctive pigmentation tricolor-triad pattern , and the egg tooth, and ~ 75 d.o. health newborns have hatched, exhibiting the umbilical scar and the egg tooth up to two days after hatching. The hematopoiesis in eggs of 1-3 and 15o.d. was characterized as extraembryonic hematopoiesis, occurring in the vessels of extraembryonic membranes and in yolk clef, and intraembryonic hematopoiesis, in the AGM (gonad mesonefron aorta), mainly within the dorsal aorta, which continues as the embryonic hematopoietic site until the 30o.d., although with better differentiated structures; wth 45o.d. the bone marrow turns the main hematopoietic site, and with a hematopoietic focus of multi-lineage blood beginning in the 60d.o. at vertebral sinus and the ribs marrow, consisting the definitive hematopoietic sites. Hematopoietic activity was observed with the kidney tissue, through development of the AGM region, between the periods of 15 to 30d.o., thymus and spleen lymphocyte differentiation have been observed at 30 . and 45o.d., respectively, and the liver does not displays embryonic hematopoiesis. This is the first description of embryonic development of an oviparous Caenophidia snake and of the embryonic hematopoiesis in Serpentes, contributing to the knowledge the physiology of these processes and demonstrating the need of further studies for a better understanding of both embryonic development and the ontogeny snake.\n",

      "Abstract:  Handball is an invasion team sport, with relations of cooperation and opposition between players. The complex and unpredictable scenario of handball is influenced by the technical and tactical elements of each phase of the game (offensive, transitions and defensive), in which players must make decisions to solve specific problems. In this way, the coach has an important pedagogical role of the teaching-learning-training process, specific to each age group, considering the cognitive and motor abilities of players, starting from general and specific contents taught from of different teaching approaches. The observation of the technical and tactical elements of the game can reveal informations about the development of the players, and provide important parameters for coaches. The aim of this research project was to identify the pedagogical procedures adopted by coaches of handball U-14 and U-16 teams to identify the contents and the teaching approaches prioritized. Thus, for the analysis of coaches speeches was used the Thematic Analysis (TA) method. Thus, it was possible to observe that, in general, offensively, in the under-14 category the coaches are divided as to the preference of the individual technical-tactical fundamentals, group tactical means and cognitive development and decision-making, while in the defensive phase they prioritize the cognitive development and decision making. Using TGfU for their teaching, and the traditional methods appear little. In the under-16 category, the group tactical means and cognitive development and decision making are the ones that occur most in the offensive and defensive phase. Like the under-14 category, TGfU is preferred over traditional methods.\n",

      "Author:  Bressan, Thais Feres (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The increasing popularity of reptiles in the pet market and in the scientific studies requires appropriate clinical and physiological knowledge, which will consequently improve the quality of care and management of this classe. It is necessary to have studies with each species in particular because of every specie of reptile has different metabolic and physiological behavior. Therefore, it was aimed localization of opioid receptor in the central nervous system (CNS) and evaluated the sedative and analgesic effect of morphine and butorphanol in Iguana iguana. At the first stage three young (101 ± 6g) and healthy green iguanas were submitted to euthanasia for harvesting the CNS, then the tissues of two animals were submitted to the RNAseq technique for the formation of de Novo transcriptome, so we could get the nucleotide sequences of the opioid receptors obtained. The immunohistochemistry (IH) technique was use to locate the distribution of these receptors in the CNS. In the second stage, 10 young green iguanas (160 ± 46 g) received five treatments, intramuscularly and with an interval of two weeks between them: saline solution (0.3 mL, CON), morphine 5 mg/kg (MOR5) and 10 mg/kg (MOR10), butorphanol 5 mg/kg (BUT5) and 10 mg/kg (BUT10). The sedation was estimate by behavioral scale for iguanas and forced swing test, during 120 seconds. The latency of hind limb withdrawal reflex (LWR) in front of the thermal stimulus was use for antinociceptive evaluation promoted by opioids. All the tests were evaluate before treatment (0) and at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours post-treatment. ANOVA and Dunnett were used for comparison with the baseline (0 minute) and two-way ANOVA and Tukey between the groups. We identified sequences compatible with μ (mu), κ (kappa) and δ (delta), but only κ and δ were marked in the IH of the CNS. In the behavior scale despite of low scores of sedation, it was observe a significant increase in the score between 30 minutes and 2 hour MOR5 and between 30 minutes and 3 hours in MOR10, BUT5 and BUT10. The time of swimming test was reduced in MOR10 and BUT5 between 30 minutes and 2 hours and in BUT10 the reduction occurred between 30 minutes and 12 hours. All treatment provided sedation for both tests in 12 hours of evaluation. Otherwise, the thermoalgymetry test showed increased time in LWR in MOR10 between 2 hours and 4 hours of evaluation. It concluded that the opioid receptors are present in the CNS. In addition, the two doses of butorphanol and the highest dose of morphine further sedation and only 10 mg/kg of morphine promoted antinociception in iguanas in this study.\n",

      "Author:  Medeiros, Alessandra (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Presynaptic a2-adrenoceptors (a2 AR) regulate the cardiovascular function by inhibiting neurotransmitter release on the sympathetic nerve terminals. We have recently reported that disruption for both a2A and a2C AR subtypes in mice (KO) leads to sympathetic hyperactivity with evidence of cardiac dysfunction by 4 mo of age. These mice provide a model system for evaluating non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches for the prevention and treatment of heart failure. We investigated whether exercise training would improve the cardiac function and expression of myocardial Ca2+ handling proteins in KO. Methods and Results: We studied a cohort of congenic KO and their wild type (WT) controls over a period of 2 months (from 3-5 mo of age). Mice from both groups were randomly assigned into sedentary and trained. Exercise training (ET) consisted of 8-wk swimming session of 60 minutes, 5 days/wk. Blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were determined non-invasively by tail cuff. Cardiac contractility was evaluated by echocardiography. Exercise capacity was measured using a graded treadmill protocol. Cardiac sympathetic tone was estimated by pharmacological blockade of muscarinic receptors with atropine in the presence or absence of the b-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol. Cardiomyocyte cross-sectional diameter and cardiac collagen fraction were evaluated by optical microscopy. The protein expression of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (SERCA2), phospholamban (PLB), phospho-Ser16-PLB, phospho-Thr17-PLB, sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX), ryanodine receptor (RYR), phospho-Ser2809-RYR2, and phosphatases 1 and 2A were analyzed using Western blotting technique. At 3 mo of age, no significant difference in blood pressure, FS and exercise capacity was observed between WT and KO mice, although KO mice had significantly higher HR. At 5 mo of age, when cardiac dysfunction is in an early stage, KO presented exercise intolerance and higher HR with significantly increased cardiac sympathetic tone (34%), cardiomyocyte cross-sectional diameter (15%) and cardiac collagen fraction (32%) when compared with WT mice. In addition, KO presented lower FS than WT mice (16± 0.2 vs. 20± 0.9%, p£0.05). The impaired FS in KO was associated with a reduction of SERCA2 (26%) and NCX (34%) expression. Conversely, phospho-Ser16-PLB and phospho-Ser2809-RYR2 was 56% and 42% increased in KO when compared with WT mice, respectively. ET prevented exercise intolerance and systolic dysfunction, normalized baseline HR and cardiac sympathetic tone, while it did not change cardiac collagen fraction. The improved ventricular function was associated with restored SERCA2 and phospho-Ser2809-RYR2 expression levels. Indeed, ET increased SERCA/PLB ratio and phospho-Ser16-PLB expression in 5 mo-old KO mice. Conclusion: Our data provide evidence of molecular mechanisms by which ET is a successful adjuvant to pharmacological therapy of HF.\n",

      "Author:  Caminiti, Gustavo Bussi (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Dengue is the most important among the arboviruses, which affects man and represents a severe Public Health Problem. In Brazil, dengue is present in all 27 states of the Federation, distribution across 3,794 cities, and is responsible for about 60% of the notifications in the Americas. One of the cities in the State of São Paulo with one of the highest confirmed case ratios is Ribeirão Preto. This study aimed to characterize the spatial pattern and associate the cases of dengue with the climatological variables in the city of Ribeirão Preto between 2001 and 2010. Research with a hybrid, ecological and temporal trend design. The population included the confirmed cases of dengue among residents. The data were collected from the National Disease Notification System, the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics, DATASUS and Instituo Agronômico de Campinas. For the purpose of geocoding, the addressing method was used. The behavior patterns of the geocoded case points were described using Kernel density estimation and analyzed according to the nearest neighbor method. To calculate the bivariate linear correlation between new dengue cases and the climatological variables, Spearman and Pearson's Linear Correlation Coefficients were used, according to the time lag concept. Approval for the project was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at the University of São Paulo at Ribeirão Preto College of Nursing. The thematic maps, complemented by the neighborhood analysis, showed a concentration of cases in regions of the city that show high demographic density, horizontal habitations, lower socioeconomic conditions, with a visible accumulation of non-conditioned recyclable material, favoring the creation of water deposits. The time lag method showed that the climatic conditions were positively related with the transmission of dengue between two and four months after its occurrence. The results presented here can be used as a strategy to plan public actions to improve the population's health\n",

      "Title:  Social representations of primary health care nurses on dengue\n",
      "Author:  Nascimento, Murilo César do (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Dengue advances as an increasingly significant social problem. Thus, this study was developed with the aim to learn the meanings of Dengue for primary health care nurses from Alfenas, in the state of Minas Gerais; and to identify limiting and driving forces for its control. A social representation study was developed, with a qualitative approach, and the adoption of the social representation theory as its theoreticalmethodological framework. Field work consisted of individual interviews with nurses from the primary health care units of the city, between June and July of 2015; which were recorded, transcribed and later analyzed and presented by means of the discourse of the collective subject method. The 17 professionals interviewed had a nursing undergraduate degree, were women and had a mean age of 40 years. They presented a median length of activity in primary health care of five years, with most nurses being members of urban family health teams; and three nurses had already been infected by the Dengue virus. The collective subject resulted in the following social representations: extreme discomfort, public health problem, people's negligence, consequence of the lack of education, viral disease, concern and fear, severe disease, disease caused by a mosquito bite, epidemic, poor country's disease, one more disease for us to care for, and a war. According to the nurses, factors that make the control of Dengue difficult include: the population's lack of awareness, people's resistance and lack of responsibility, the mosquitoes' rapid spread, the high amount of focuses, rumors, lack of information on the disease, lack of knowledge on its cause, lack of qualification of workers of endemic diseases control, and lack of supervision on the work of community health workers. Factors that facilitate the disease control include the work to guide, educate and raise people's awareness, basic sanitation, partnerships of family health teams and endemic diseases control workers, demanding the population's commitment, better qualification and remuneration of endemic diseases control workers and the population's duty being served. Knowledge about social representations on Dengue is important to understand its causality and to cope with this current public health problem. This study managed to give rise to values and symbols of the collective subject of primary health care nurses from Alfenas on Dengue and the coping with the epidemic, which contributed to enhance the intelligence of health services, since these professionals work at the frontline of the city, promoting the fight against the disease.\n",

      "Author:  Villela, Edlaine Faria de Moura (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Introduction There is limited knowledge in the field of Public Health about the social role of media in health and particularly on the relationship between the media and the context of an epidemic associated with biological vectors such as dengue. So, it was decided to study the first epidemic of dengue at Ribeirao Preto, which occurred between November 1990 and March 1991. This epidemic, like the others, was studied only in its biological aspect, ignoring the social aspect, which justifies this study. Aim The aim of this study was to investigate how was the media construction of the first epidemic of dengue in Ribeirao Preto, from November 1990 to March 1991 for the readers of newspapers and magazines circulating at the time. Method The research material were reports of newspapers and magazines made at Ribeirao Preto and at the capital of the State of Sao Paulo - the large circulation - at the time of the first dengue epidemic at Ribeirao Preto, from November 1990 to March 1991. The method adopted was the Collective Subject Discourse, which is based on the Social Representations Theory. Results Social representations in the media were rescued in the media and also the power of diffusion of these representations in the process of scientific diffusion to the general public during the first dengue epidemic. The analysis of media content allowed to present the main issues in the newspapers and magazines through the speeches elaboration. Conclusions In this research, it could be understood how was the construction of meanings about dengue: the newspaper created a reality epidemic. The lag of information provided by mass media was proven and there was political bias in the news published, diverting the attention that should be directed towards education and health promotion. A professional transiting the interface Public Health and Communication is important so that political issues do not prevail on priority issues of health in printed media\n",

      "Author:  Murizine, Gabriela Souza (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Introduction - Dengue is an arbovirosis transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes that is responsible for an acute febrile illness present in more than 120 countries. It is considered the arbovirosis of greatest importance in public health, with an epidemiological relevance in Brazil and tropical countries all around the world. Identifying the influence of existing factors and health actions that are already being developed on the incidence of dengue in the territories makes it possible to improve investments and efforts to combat the disease. Goal Establish temporal trend and characterize the incidence's spatial dependency, its correlation with epidemic moments from 2005 to 2019 and evaluate the impact of the different interventions applied in 2017 by the Primary Health Care on dengue's incidence in Brazilian cities in the following years, 2018 and 2019. Methods This is an ecological study base of public domain secondary data. At first, the dengue incidence rates in Brazilian federal units and cities that reported the case number in that period were calculated. The dengue's incidence rates tendencies were also calculated with the incidence's rates historical series by Prais-Winsten regression. Moran global index was used to analyze spatial dependency. Spearmans' correlation coefficient was obtained between the resultant z-values of the randomized Moran's test and the incidence rates presented during that period of time. A multiple model was developed using Poisson's regression to explore the predictive contextual socio-economic variables of the diseases' incidence in Brazilian cities. This model was used as a covariable pre-selection for the adjustments in the impact evaluation in 2018-2019 of the different interventions applied in 2017 by the primary health, this was done using multilevel negative binomial analysis. Results - During the time specified in this study, 11.453.537 dengue cases were registered in Brazil. The dengue annual incidence rate varied from 82,2 (2005) and 830,4 (2015) cases per 100 thousand habitants/year, the median being 296,2 cases per 100 thousand habitants/year. Five out of the 15 years (2010, 2013, 2015, 2016 e 2019) were epidemic and represented 7.191.819 (63%) of cases during the whole period. After analyzing the incidence rate in the Brazilian states and regions, the central region showed to have a mild increasing tendency while the rest of the country showed a stationary tendency. A positive, yet moderate, correlation was found between the z-values in the first Moran´s test and the dengue's incidence rates (Spearman´s coefficient was 0.543 and P value 0.036). Out of the 33 interventions applied by the primary health, 22 (68,75%) were statistically and positively associated with dengue's incidence rate in the following years. Conclusion - The incidence was stationary in most states, indicating little progress in its control. The period was marked by large epidemics, when some correspondence with spatial aggregation patterns were observed. Some primary care activities seem to have increased the sensitivity for case detection in the territory.\n",

      "Author:  Sanches, Rosângela Peregrina (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  The basic reproduction number,R_0, is defined as the expected number of secondary cases of a disease produced by a single infection in a susceptible population. If R_0 < 1 the disease cannot establish in the population, and if R_0 > 1 we expect the disease spread in the population. The value of R_0 can be estimated in several ways, for example, with the stability analysis of a compartmental model, through the matrix of next generation, using the final phase of an epidemic, etc. In this work we studied methods for estimating R_0 from the initial growth phase of the outbreak, without assuming exponential growth of cases, which is suggested in most studies. We used the methods proposed by Nishiura, Ross-Macdonald and White and Pagano. The objective of this work was to compare these techniques and to evaluate how these technique estimate the value of the basic reproduction number, applying them to diseases caused by vectors. In this particular case we used data of dengue. We used data from the city of Ribeirão Preto in the periods of 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, in both cases the city had an outbreak. The results obtained by the three methods are numerically different. We can conclude that all methods are correct in the sense that dengue will spread in the city studied, what is true for the cases studied, although they are numerically different. Weekly analysis of the data show that the estimated values have a same pattern over time\n",

      "Abstract:  INTRODUCTION: Developing a better understanding of the knowledge and practices about dengue is essential to planning programs and public policies about the prevention of the disease. This research aimed to investigate the knowledge of users of primary health care services, living in Ribeirão Preto city, about dengue and its vector (transmission, symptoms, prevention and treatment), the source of the information, practices, and their associations with the knowledge and beliefs for the prophylaxis and treatment of disease. METHODS: This cross-sectional questionnaire survey of a sample of 605 people living in Ribeirão Preto was conducted following a major dengue outbreak in 2013. The respondents were invited to participate in the study at the time when they were waiting for medical attendance in the health units. RESULTS: The main source of information about dengue was from the television (87.8%). Fever was cited as the most common symptom of the disease. Only 10.4% of the respondents use mosquito repellent regularly to prevent dengue. When shown images of different species of insects, 65.7% of the participants were able to identify correctly the vector of the disease. This percentage is larger among younger participants with higher levels of education. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented in this research are similar to those described by other authors cited here and reinforce the relevance of health education programs, the constant promotion of educational campaigns in the media, the role of the television as a source of information and the importance of motivating the population to control the vector\n",

      "Author:  Oliveira, Maria Aparecida de (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  Introduction: It is estimated that 2.5 billion people live in areas at risk of dengue fever in more than 100 endemic countries. Over 50 million infections occur annually with 500,000 cases of DHF and 22,000 deaths, mostly among children. The city of Araraquara, despite having good social and economic conditions, had severe dengue epidemics in the last decade. Objective: This study examined the urban socio-environmental factors associated with the incidence of dengue in Araraquara, which is a medium-sized city located in the state of São Paulo, in southeastern Brazil in the years 1998 to 2008. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal ecological study, which evaluated data on the incidence of dengue reported in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN) in all epidemiological weeks of the years 1998 to 2008, for the city of Araraquara. The urban social and environmental variables investigated were taken from the census, satellite images and geo-referenced data layers of the built environment. The meteorological variables investigated were obtained from an automatic station with daily measurements for the whole period. To investigate the pattern of spatial and temporal distribution of the incidence of dengue in the city, we used the techniques of exploratory spatial data analysis. To investigate the independent effect of urban social and environmental variables on the occurrence of dengue cases in the census tracts of Araraquara, over the period 1998 to 2008, we used multivariate analysis models for longitudinal data, and generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results: We identified seasonal patterns of dengue incidence. Significant effects were observed for urban social and environmental variables, including meteorological variables, epidemiological and built environment as risk factors to the occurrence of dengue and these factors vary in time and space. Conclusion: The results showed the complexity of factors associated with the incidence of dengue in the city of Araraquara, which involves urban socio-environmental factors at different spatial and temporal scales. The consideration of these factors in the planning of public policies can be important to deal with this serious problem of urban health.\n",

      "Author:  Scandar, Sirle Abdo Salloum (Catálogo USP)\n",
      "Abstract:  It was georeferenced 14.554 cases of dengue. The largest incidences in the period were observed in the areas 7 and 8 (east and center areas respectively). In these areas, the incidence varied from 381 to 432 for 100.000 inhabitants. The index of Moran estimated was of 0,2517 with most of the spatial agglomerates in the east area, followed by the center and north areas. It was observed that the area that presented the largest number of cases of dengue was that with medium demographic density, income and education degree pattern. The dengue incidence was larger in individuals in the age group of the 15 to the 49 years and 50 years and older, and smaller in the age group zero to 14 years. Regarding to incidence for sex, it was observed that there were small variations, being slightly higher in the female gender. The results of the analysis of Correlation of Pearson for dengue incidence suggest that the precipitation and temperature influence were not statistically significant, but they were in relation to the Building Index (Índice Predial). In the analysis of the distribution of the immature stages of the Aedes aegypti in different recipients, it was observed that the vase deserved larger prominence, followed by can, pot and flask. The spatial distribution of the dengue did not present uniform pattern, because the incidence rate varied in the several areas. Dengue high incidences were observed as much in areas with high socioeconomic pattern as in those with lower pattern. The larval infestation level, estimated by the Building Index it was larger in the rainy period. The results of this study, in relation to the vector, confirmed the characteristic of opportunist species that was already registered for the Aedes aegypti in other areas. The immature stages of the insect, in spite of they be more frequent in some types of recipients, for instance, in vases, they can occupy other, depending on the readiness of the same ones.\n",

      "Abstract:  The spatial analysis techniques constitute an important tool for understanding the conditions that make up the process of dengue virus transmission, contributing to the provision of subsidies for the surveillance and control of the disease. The purpose of this study was to characterize the spatial distribution of dengue cases through mapping of cases in the city of Osasco in the period from 2007 to 2013; also, identify the spatial distribution and temporal space risk of dengue; evaluate the relationship between the incidence rates of dengue cases with the larval indices; as well evaluate the relationship between dengue and socioeconomic factors. Data were obtained from Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação (SINAN Information System for Notifiable Diseases). The annual incidence, the main frequency measures of the disease and the correlation of the Breteau indexes (BI) and cases of dengue cases were analysed. Dengue cases registered in the city were geocoded by street names and grouped according to 928 census tracts, thus generating thematic maps. Incidence rates were calculated for the study period, as well as the identification of higher and lower-risk areas for spaceand space-time clusters of dengue. It was used the discrete Poisson model to identified the clusters of higher or lower risk for the occurrence of dengue cases in space and space-time. The spatial dependence of dengue cases was measured by Moran index. Through linear and spatial regression analysis techniques socioeconomic variables were associated with dengue cases, in order to seek the best model to clarify the association dengue cases with socioeconomic factors. In all the years there have been cases of dengue and the incidence was higher in the months from March to May. The maps showed the spatial and temporal distribution of dengue in the city space. However, there was no statistical correlation between cases of dengue and the IB. The spatio-temporal analysis, they identified a high risk cluster, located in the northern area for the period from February to May 2007, and another low-risk cluster. The number of cases of dengue was higher in areas without water supply system, garbage collection service, brown residents and per capita domiciliary income of 1 to 2 minimum wages. The spatial regression model was more efficient in trying to explain the occurrence of dengue cases in relation to linear models. In conclusion, the dengue incidence rates at epidemic and inter-epidemic periods suggest that dengue cases transmission is endemic in the city of Osasco. The occurrence of dengue has no uniform distribution pattern. The Spatial analysis, timeline and regression modeling indicate that dengue cases reached different socioeconomic strata, as a result, is attributing to spatial heterogeneity of living conditions of the population. Therefore, the results raise the need for specific studies of the methods being used to measure infestation of Ae. aegypti in the city.

      "Abstract:  This study aims to characterize the dengue transmission in th e regions of São José do Rio Preto and Araçatuba, São Paulo, between 1990 and 1996. Incidence Rates (IR) of in laboratory confirmed dengue cases as well as autochthonous dengue cases have been analyzed according to areas, gender and age. Monthly IR curves have been analyzed for the regions, sub-regions and municipal districts. A spatial analysis has been carried out relating the IR with social-economical and demographic variables. Weekly IR curves of both suspected cases and in laboratory confirmed dengue cases have been built in order to investigate the relationship between them. The obtained IR point for a risk of hemorrhagic dengue occurrence. It was noticed a higher risk of dengue occurrence for women and among people between 30 and 59 years. In the last studied periods it was also noticed greater incidence in several sub-areas and increase of month periods with transmission, indicating a possible disease spreading. The transmission, in general, started and finished in large municipal districts, and in those the transmission period was more frequent. It was also observed that, in large municipal districts with better educational level and income variables, IR showing higher levels occured in a larger exrtent than in smaller ones whose indicators of those variables were worst, and the explanation for this can be related with the attraction exercised by the great population centers. These evidences have showed that a possible risk factor to be used in the stratification of the control measures would be the size of the municipal district. It was obtained the relationship between the IR series of suspected dengue cases and in laboratory confirmed cases enabling us to measure the last ones starting from the first ones.\n",

      "Abstract:  Dengue fever has become a major health problem in some modem urban settings, since those places hold the characteristics implicated in dengue occurrence. The inherent aspects of urbanization experienced by Brazilian cities, as Sao Paulo, resulted in favorable conditions for vector dissemination and dengue outbreaks, through introduction of the virus by imported cases. Sao Paulo city had, however, always registered a greater amount of imported cases over locally transmitted cases, since the year of 2003, when the municipality experienced a dengue outbreak marked by local transmission of the disease (incidence of 7,2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, with 787 local cases and 779 imported cases). Identification of dengue spatial clusters as well as its demographic and socioeconomic characteristics could provide relevant information concerning to dengue's spatial pattern especially in complexes urban settings, as Sao Paulo. In this sense, Geoprocessing techniques, in special, the Geographical Information System (GIS) poses a new approach of the space concerning to epidemiological studies. Kernel density estimation, a spatial analytic tool inserted in GIS, allows identification and delimitation of dengue spatial clusters, as well as demographic and socioeconomic characteristics implicated in different urban scenarios. The outbreak experienced by the city in the year of 2003 revealed that imported cases showed a more dispersed pattern of distribution, occurring in the majority of the urban districts and performing a cluster in the central region of the city, marked by better socioeconomic profile and major population and house density. Locally transmitted cases occurred in a less dispersed pattern, performing four spatially disjoint clusters in city's peripheral regions, except by Mooca district. The regions related to local Dengue clusters had minor population density, less house density, unfavorable income status and a worse educational profile.\n",

Therefore, the results raise the need for specific studies of the methods being used to measure infestation of Ae. aegypti in the city. The method proved to be suitable for areas of risk identification and consequently direct actions and resources of government\n",

      "Abstract:  Introduction: Dengue is an infection disease which is caused by an arbovirus related to tropical and subtropical region. Most cases usually occur on warm and rainy weathers of the years that facilitate the conditions of the development vector of the disease, the Aedes Aegypti mosquito. Statistical models can be very useful to comprehend the monthly variations of the number of registered cases of the disease, and they might bring reasonable predictions to the monthly number of cases in a subsequent period to a studied time series. Metodology: This dissertation is about ecologic study with a time series component. It was used monthly registry of confirmed dengue cases, between 1998 and 2008 years, obtained by the Information Center of Notification Diseases (ICND), out of two cities in the state of São Paulo (Campinas and Ribeirão Preto). Statistic time series models were used to describe the data series behavior and to predict the average number of disease cases in the subsequent period. We used the Box & Jenkins model, that in, the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model, with extensions (SARIMAX model) that allow to incorporate co-variables to the maximum, mean and minimum temperatures and the average monthly precipitation. We used the Akaike criterio (AIC) for comparison between different model specifications. From the fit data models, we obtained monthly predictions to the 2009 year, being compared to the observed data. Results: Without considerating the inclusion of the covariables, the best model for Campinas data was the SARIMA(2,1,2)(1,1,1)12, and for Ribeirão Preto data the best was SARIMA(2,1,3)(1,1,1)12 (smaller AIC values models). As we incorporate the climate variables in the models, we observe that the best fit for Campinas city was the SARIMAX(1,1,1)1,1,1)12 that includes the observed precipitation in 2 months before the monthly dengue cases and the minimum registered temperature in 3 months before. In Ribeirão Preto city, the most adequate model was the SARIMAX(1,1,1)(0,1,1)12 that includes the observed precipitation in 3 months before the monthly dengue case occurrence and the minimum temperature in one month before. The monthly prediction obtained for 2009 year show reasonably close to the observed, in both cities. Conclusion: The results of this study, in addition to the literature results, show that the adequate number of autoregressive and moving average components fitted in SARIMA models, vary between one population and other, suggesting different disease time patterns according to local characteristics. Comparing predict and observed values suggest that the SARIMA models are useful tools to predict the number of dengue cases. We suggest that the models in this dissertation be used in city health services to surveillance the disease, which may bring benefits for prevention programs and public service planning.\n",
